["Ecommerce enabled social innovation is becoming increasingly important as a way of reducing poverty in developing countries and yet has not been studied much by the IS community. We utilize the concept of resource orchestration as a theoretical lens to develop a fit model that explicates how resources are orchestrated under the guidance of either an indigenous, exogenous or collaborative strategy to achieve ecommerce enabled social innovation.", "The findings show how resources are orchestrated through the following specific resourcefocused actions collaborating, linking and enriching, which are influenced by the types of strategies applied. Our study also identifies different resource portfolios that influence the type of ecommerce enabled social innovation that can be achieved. This research benefits both academics and practitioners by contributing to cumulative theoretical developments related to ecommerce enabled social innovation and the resource orchestration perspective, and by offering corresponding practical insights to achieve fit between strategy, resource orchestration and social innovation."]
