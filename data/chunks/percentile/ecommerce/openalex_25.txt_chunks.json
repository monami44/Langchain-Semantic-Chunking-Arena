["This study builds on resource based view RBV theory by examining the effects of ecommerce on exporting performance. Specifically, a framework is developed and tested to determine the ecommerce resourcescapabilitiesmarketing efficienciesperformance relationship. To explore the impact of ecommerce on exporting, a twostage methodological approach was employed. Results from 15 depth interviews with exporters were used to gain insight into types of ecommerce resources and capabilities and their impact on export marketing efficiencies and performance.", "Next, the framework was empirically tested using a sample of 340 exporters. The evidence shows that specialized ecommerce marketing capabilities directly increase a firms degree of distribution and communication efficiency, which in turn leads to enhanced export venture market performance. Overall, the analyses provide support for the need to incorporate ecommerce constructs into existing RBV theory in export marketing. Theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed and directions for future research are offered."]
