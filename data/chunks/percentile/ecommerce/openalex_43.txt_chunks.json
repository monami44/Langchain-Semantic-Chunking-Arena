["Electroniccommerce has become an important channel for conducting business.", "Researchers as well as market executives are trying to better understand online consumer behavior. One model used by researchers to understand behavior in the information systems field in general is the technology acceptance model TAM. The TAM variables are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and intentions. In this study, we suggest the extension of the TAM for its application in the Ecommerce field. The original TAM will be extended, by adding four predictor variables. The four predictor variables are process satisfaction, outcome satisfaction, expectations, and Ecommerce use. In addition, the TAM will be extended by measuring actual behavior as opposed to measuring intentions as a substitute for actual behavior in previous TAM application studies. We suggest measuring actual use variable in terms of four criterion variables, namely, purchase, access number, access total time, and access average time. The extended TAM is expected to better explain actual behavior in Ecommerce environments than the original TAM."]
