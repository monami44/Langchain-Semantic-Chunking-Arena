["The Second World War became the backdrop of Japanese espionage activities in Latin America that helped to delay the total expulsion of Japanese officers and businesses from the Americas and confinement of Japanese communities. Based on archival information gathered in Japan, the US and Chile, the article examines Japans intelligencegathering activity in Chile and pays attention to its composition and limitations. By doing so, it reexamines the transnationality of Japans state apparatuses in South America and Chiles place in the global conflict.", "The article advances the argument that Japans subversive activities in Chile were relentless and had a regional scope beyond one nationstate.
