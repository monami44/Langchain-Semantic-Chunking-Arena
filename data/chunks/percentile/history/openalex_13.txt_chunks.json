["There are many similarities between the Nordic countries of Sweden and Finland, but they have made different decisions regarding their teachereducation policies. This article focuses on how the objectives of teacher education, particularly the vision of the ideal teacher, have changed in Sweden and Finland in the period after the Second World War. In Finland, the period since the 1960s can be described as a gradual scientification of teacher education.", "The image of the ideal teacher has transformed according to a researchbased agenda, where teachers are expected to conduct minorscale research in the classroom. In Sweden since the 1980s, on the other hand, teacher education has oscillated between progressivist and academic orientations, following shifts in government between the Social Democratic Party and the centreright. Since the turn of the millennium, however, a consensus in favour of a strengthened research base of teacher education has also emerged in Sweden."]
