["In this Special Issue, the authors explore the various ways in which the Second World War shaped childrens experiences in the postwar period. They map the multifaceted interest or noninterest of states all over Europe for children in the years after the war, filter out groups of children who recall that the consequences of the Second World War significantly influenced their childhood, and investigate the childhood policies directed towards them, as well as their childhood experiences and the memories they foster about their childhood.", "In addition, they have included case studies from Western, Central and Eastern Europe with the aim of sparking a debate as to whether it was only a similar lifecycle that war children in early postwar Europe shared, or if they also had some life experiences in common."]
