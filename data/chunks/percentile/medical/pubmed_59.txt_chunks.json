INTRODUCTIONOBJECTIVE We investigated 1 work status changes during COVID19, 2 financial resource adequacy, 3 preferences for work requirements e.g. remote, workplace, mixed and 4 work requirements versus preferences, among people with systemic sclerosis. METHODS This was a crosssectional study of participants in the Scleroderma Patientcentered Intervention Network COVID19 Cohort, which enrolled participants from the ongoing Scleroderma Patientcentered Intervention Network Cohort and externally in April 2020. In August 2022, participants completed questions on work status, financial wellbeing using the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Financial WellBeing Scale, work requirements and work requirement preferences. RESULTS A total of 298 participants with systemic sclerosis were included. Mean age was 58.6 years SD 11.4. There were 101 34 participants working at the start of the pandemic and still working in August 2022, 179 60 not working at the start of the pandemic and still not working, 10 3 who stopped working after April 2020 and 8 3 who started working. Mean financial wellbeing did not change from April 2020 to August 2022 difference 0.2 points 95 confidence interval 1.1 to 0.7. Working participants N 109 preferred flexible work requirements N 34, 31 or working entirely remotely N 32, 29, but most were required to work entirely at a workplace N 35, 32 or combined workplace and remotely with a fixed schedule N 31, 28. CONCLUSION Work status and financial wellbeing did not change substantively among people with systemic sclerosis during the pandemic. Flexible work policies may support people with systemic sclerosis to work. The Authors 2024.

BACKGROUND Visual interpretation of PET and CMR may fail to identify cardiac sarcoidosis CS with high specificity. This study aimed to evaluate the role of 18FFDG PET and late gadolinium enhancement LGECMR radiomic features in differentiating CS from another cause of myocardial inflammation, in this case patients with cardiacrelated clinical symptoms following COVID19. METHODS 18FFDG PET and LGECMR were treated separately in this work. There were 35 postCOVID19 PC and 40 CS datasets. Regions of interest were delineated manually around the entire left ventricle for the PET and LGECMR datasets. Radiomic features were then extracted. The ability of individual features to correctly identify image data as CS or PC was tested to predict the clinical classification of CS vs. PC using MannWhitney Utests and logistic regression. Features were retained if the Pvalue was 0.00053, the AUC was 0.5, and the accuracy was 0.7. After applying the correlation test, uncorrelated features were used as a signature joint features to train machine learning classifiers. For LGECMR analysis, to further improve the results, different classifiers were used for individual features besides logistic regression, and the results of individual features of each classifier were screened to create a signature that included all features that followed the previously mentioned criteria and used it them as input for machine learning classifiers. RESULTS The MannWhitney Utests and logistic regression were trained on individual features to build a collection of features. For 18FFDG PET analysis, the maximum targettobackground ratio TBRmax showed a high area under the curve AUC and accuracy with small Pvalues 0.00053, but the signature performed better AUC 0.98 and accuracy 0.91. For LGECMR analysis, the Gray Level Dependence Matrix gldmDependence NonUniformity showed good results with small error bars accuracy 0.75 and AUC 0.87. However, by applying a Support Vector Machine classifier to individual LGECMR features and creating a signature, a Random Forest classifier displayed better AUC and accuracy 0.91 and 0.84, respectively. CONCLUSION Using radiomic features may prove useful in identifying individuals with CS. Some features showed promising results in differentiating between PC and CS. By automating the analysis, the patient management process can be accelerated and improved. 2024 Mushari, Soultanidis, Duff, Trivieri, Fayad, Robson and Tsoumpas.
