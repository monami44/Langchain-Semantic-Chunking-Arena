Background objectives Krebs von den Lungen6 KL6 is primarily expressed by the damaged type II pneumocytes. In this context, the relationship of KL6 with blood gas analysis BGA parameters and Brixia score is still limitedly discussed. This study aims to analyze the correlation of KL6, BGA and Brixia scores to the severity and mortality of COVID19. Methods A crosssectional study was conducted in adult COVID19 positive individuals at Universitas Airlangga Hospital, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, from March to August 2021. KL6, BGA, and Brixia scores were compared according to severity severe vs.", "nonsevere and mortality nonsurvivor vs. survivor. The receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis was also performed to define the optimal cutoff, sensitivity, as well as the specificity of KL6, BGA and Brixia scores to determine the COVID19 severity and mortality. Results Total 35 severe and 20 nonsevere COVID19 positive individuals were enrolled in this study. Of those, there were 22 nonsurvivors. No significant difference in serum KL6 levels was observed in the severity and mortality groups. KL6 and HCO3 had positive correlation in the severe group r0.37. KL6 and Brixia scores showed a significant negative correlation among COVID19 positive individuals r0.283 P0.036. KL6 and Brixia scores together served as the best severity markers in the current study AUC 0.809 0.6970.920 SnSp0.6860.900, followed by KL6 and PF ratio AUC 0.800 0.6370.963 SnSp0.9710.750. Interpretation conclusions The findings of this study suggest that KL6 has the potential to be a useful adjunct laboratory parameter to the BGA and Brixia score representing COVID19 severity and mortality.
