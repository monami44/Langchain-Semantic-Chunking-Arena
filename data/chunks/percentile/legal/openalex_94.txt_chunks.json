["Vested with privileges and immunities, international organizations are neither subject to the substantive provisions of national employment law, nor to the jurisdiction of national labour courts or similar domestic judicial authorities for the adjudication of labour disputes.", "Nevertheless, it is generally recognised that staff members of international organizations are entitled to have their grievances about decisions of the organization concerning their employment be heard by an internal dispute resolution mechanism, including the right to appeal such decisions to a judicial authority for an independent review. As an international organization promoting the rule of law in the countries where it operates, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development EBRD has regularly adapted since its creation its internal dispute resolution mechanism to emerging legal trends, and the everincreasing requirements of the case law of international administrative tribunals. In the last reform of its internal justice system, initiated in 2017, the EBRD revised the first stage of its system with the aim to enhance its speed and effectiveness, at a reasonable cost for the staff members and the EBRD. Bearing in mind that the main purpose of the first stage is to establish the facts of the matter in dispute and to report the findings and recommendations to the EBRD President for decision, the EBRD has now evolved towards a more inquisitorial process. In force since February 2018, the new first stage of EBRDs internal justice system offers the necessary due process and fairness to staff members for the review of their grievances, without transforming the committee conducting that stage into a quasijudicial body. After all, the purpose of the first stage of the system is to deliver a report and recommendation to the EBRD President, assisting them in their consideration of the matter in dispute."]
