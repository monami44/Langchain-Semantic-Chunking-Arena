["Abstract The EU Water Framework Directive WFD prescribes environmental objectives and an adaptive water governance system. This article analyses the Swedish implementation of the WFD through a review of highprofile Swedish court cases regarding the application of the WFD environmental objectives in individual authorisation processes for water operations. The selection of court cases represents both the time before and after the Court of Justice of the European Unions Weser case in 2015. The results indicate an inertial tendency in the legal application of the WFD environmental objectives in Swedish courts, including a reluctance to fully apply EU law as interpreted by the CJEU. The overall conclusion is that traditional legal certainty aspects often trump flexibility and a high level of environmental protection as desired in the adaptive water governance system of the WFD.", "This raises questions about judicial preconceptions and the procedural autonomy of the Member States vis\u00e0vis the effet utile of EU law through judicial implementation."]
