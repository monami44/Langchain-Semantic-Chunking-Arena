Contributed equally BACKGROUND Despite several studies on selfevaluation of health and body shape, existing research on the risk factors of selfperceived overweight is insufficient, especially during the COVID19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE This study aims to identify the risk factors affecting selfperceived overweight and examine how the prevalence of selfperceived overweight has changed before and during the COVID19 pandemic. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of altered lifestyles due to COVID19 on this phenomenon. METHODS The data used in the study were obtained from middle and high school students who participated in the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Webbased Survey N1,189,586. This survey was a 2stage stratified cluster sampling survey representative of South Korean adolescents. We grouped the survey results by year and estimated the slope in the prevalence of selfperceived overweight before and during the pandemic using weighted linear regression, as well as the prevalence tendencies of selfperceived overweight according to various risk factors. We used prevalence ratios to identify the risk factors for selfperceived overweight. In addition, we conducted comparisons of risk factors in different periods to identify their associations with the COVID19 pandemic. RESULTS The prevalence of selfperceived overweight was much higher than BMIbased overweight among 1,189,586 middle and high school participants grade 712 from 2005 to 2022 female participants n577,102, 48.51. From 2005 to 2019 prepandemic, the prevalence of selfperceived overweight increased \u03b22.80, 95 CI 2.702.90, but from 2020 to 2022 pandemic it decreased \u03b20.53, 95 CI 0.74 to 0.33. During the pandemic, individuals with higher levels of stress or lower household economic status exhibited a more substantial decrease in the rate of selfperceived overweight. The prevalence of selfperceived overweight tended to be higher among individuals with poor academic performance, lower economic status, poorer subjective health, and a higher stress level. CONCLUSIONS Our nationwide study, conducted over 18 years, indicated that selfperceived overweight decreased during the COVID19 period while identifying low academic performance and economic status as risk factors. These findings suggest the need for policies and facilities to address serious dieting and body dissatisfaction resulting from selfperceived overweight by developing counseling programs for adolescents with risk factors such as lower school performance and economic status.
