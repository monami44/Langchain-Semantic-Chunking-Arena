BACKGROUNDS Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2. The high mortality and morbidity rate and its course with a wide variety of clinical symptoms indicate that the disease affects many metabolic pathways. The aim of our study was to investigate the metabolic effects of SARSCoV2 by evaluating the urinary organic acid profile in patients with SARSCoV2 infection. Can metabolites in urine guide the diagnosis, followup, treatment, and prognosis of COVID19? METHODS Fortytwo patients, including 30 SARSCoV2 RTPCR positive patients and 12 SARSCoV2 RTPCR negative controls, were studied. SARSCOV2 RTPCR of nasopharyngeal swab samples was studied. Urines were evaluated in the GCMSQP2010 SE Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer SHIMADZU device for organic acid profile in the metabolism laboratory. Urine organic acid profile was evaluated by studying 117 organic acids in each patient. RESULTS Tiglylglycine, 2hydroxybutyric acid, 4hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, 3hydroxypropionic acid, erythro4,5dihydroxyhexanoic acid lactone, 2hydroxyphenylacetic acid, Nacetyltyrosine, 3phenyllactic acid, 5hydroxyindolacetic acid, 3hydroxysebacic acid, palmitic acid, 3methylglutaconic acid, 3methylglutaric acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acidoxime, 3hydroxysobutyric acid, and organic acids were found to be increased, compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS Tiglylglycine has been specifically identified as a potential biomarker of respiratory chain disorders. The deterioration in lipid metabolism and pyruvate pathway in COVID19 patients was evaluated as remarkable. DOI 10.7754Clin.Lab.2024.240319 PMID 39382928 Indexed for MEDLINE"]
