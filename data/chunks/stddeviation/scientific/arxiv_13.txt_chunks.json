["Automated machine learning AutoML aims to find optimal machine learning solutions automatically given a machine learning problem. It could release the burden of data scientists from the multifarious manual tuning process and enable the access of domain experts to the offtheshelf machine learning solutions without extensive experience. In this paper, we review the current developments of AutoML in terms of three categories, automated feature engineering AutoFE, automated model and hyperparameter learning AutoMHL, and automated deep learning AutoDL. Stateoftheart techniques adopted in the three categories are presented, including Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithm, and gradientbased approaches. We summarize popular AutoML frameworks and conclude with current open challenges of AutoML."]
