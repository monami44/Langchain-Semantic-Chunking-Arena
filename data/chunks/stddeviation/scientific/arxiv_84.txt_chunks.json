["Machine learning workflow development is anecdotally regarded to be an iterative process of trialanderror with humansintheloop. However, we are not aware of quantitative evidence corroborating this popular belief. A quantitative characterization of iteration can serve as a benchmark for machine learning workflow development in practice, and can aid the development of humanintheloop machine learning systems. To this end, we conduct a smallscale survey of the applied machine learning literature from five distinct application domains. We collect and distill statistics on the role of iteration within machine learning workflow development, and report preliminary trends and insights from our investigation, as a starting point towards this benchmark. Based on our findings, we finally describe desiderata for effective and versatile humanintheloop machine learning systems that can cater to users in diverse domains."]
