See e.g., J. Holder M. Lee, Environmental Protection, Law, and Policy Text and Materials 2nd ed. 2007 at 627669 and the reappraisal of Lysters assessment at various points in M. Bowman, P. Davies, C. Redgwell, Lysters International Wildlife Law 2nd ed., 2010. Although, as a recent essay perceptively notes, when you look at the fine print The Habitats directive stipulates a procedure for balancing species and habitat protection on one hand and potentially harmful human activities on the other. But the directive does not address how nature and human activities have to be balanced, where the deliberation should take place, whether it should be embedded in existing mechanisms for spatial planning or not, or which kind of rules and policies should be employed in the implementation. It only stipulates that valuable habitats require delineation and protection in EU member states, and that this protection needs to have consequences for human use i.e. it ought to provoke an informed discussion whenever human use threatens to alter these highquality habitats emphasis added and references omitted.

It is important to note that EU Directives are implemented at the discretion of member states and in accordance with the domestic policies of each state. In those states, then, where there is no substantial body of wellestablished and wellobserved rules and regulations governing land use planning and decision making, and especially governing the impacts of land development on habitats and species, implementation of the Directives is bound to be to some degree laggard. It is a hallmark of the literature on the Directives that it deals for the most part with member states where the implementation deficit is relatively modest, such as the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, and France. This is, of course, useful, but a poor guide to the outcomes implementation produces in, say, Greece, Italy, and even Ireland. See the sources cited in note 14, infra.5 Council of Europe, 1979.

The European Environment Agency portal into data on this topic is online at httpwww.eea.europa.euthemesbiodiversitywherewestandwheredoeseuropestandin2010 accessed 30 July 2013.18 Ferranti, Beunen, Speranza 2010, supra note 14.19 Beunen, Van Assche, Duineveld 2013, supra note 2, at 280.20 This thesis emerges from several strands of work on Europeanization and domestic political change and is masterfully applied to compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives in Ireland in Laffan OMahony 2008, supra note 14.21 The sense that beneath all the twists and turns of litigation, court decisions, administrative adaptations, and interest group strategizing swirling around the Directives there lies a basic set of questions about power over land use, which are enduring and may have no clear resolution emerges very clearly from the account of proposals for British port development in Morris 2011, supra note 14. Raoul Beunen and his colleagues are equally clear that in the Netherlands the preoccupation with procedural compliance has not led to substantive success for wildlife values. They point out that in the beginning compliance was treated as a mere formality, because the Dutch conservation model was considered to be the model for the European directives. Beunen, Van Assche, Duineveld 2013, supra note 2, at 283. This changed after a small environmental NGO, Das en Boom, successfully used the Habitats directive to challenge in court the development of a new business park in Heerlen. Their legal victory stirred a lot of media attention. According to Das en Boom, the permitting process was incomplete since the impact studies required by the Habitats directive were not conducted. The judges agreed. After a string of court cases, many actors became aware of the potential impact of the Birds and Habitats directives. In the following years, more developments and activities were challenged including the extension of the A73 highway, the fishing rights for cockles in the Wadden Sea and the enlargement of the Port of Rotterdam. Id. citations omitted. The victories conservationists seemed to be winning in court proved shortlived, however. The other developer parties became more successful after they learned that more substantial impact studies could be used to win a case and that in local coalitions, strong arguments could be formed to present a proposed project as an overriding public benefit. In other words, it slowly dawned on both conservationists and economic actors that the procedural side of the legal argument was much more important than the substantive side, and that both substantive and procedural sides could be manipulated to a certain extent. Furthermore, conservation organizations realized that procedural battles over small sites and animals were eroding longstanding public support for nature conservation. They noticed that their role in policy making and planning was less and less accepted by other actors and by the general public, and that even their right to exist was questioned regularly. Id. at 284 citations omitted.22 The conference, known as the first Kingsland Conference in honor of the late Christopher Kingsland Q.C., an eminent barrister and leading member of the environmental bar in Britain, was held at Kings College, London, in March, 2011.23 The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3 at xii.24 The table of cases runs to nine pages in id, at xxiiixxxi, and includes decisions from courts in Canada, the European Union judiciary, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the International Court of Justice. The bulk of the decisions directly germane to the Directives that are considered in detail are from European and British courts.25 The clearest account of how European jurisprudence on the Directives has evolved in relation to the mandate to protect species appears in Charles George David Graham, After Morge, Where Are We Now? The Meaning of Disturbance in the Habitats Directive, id. at 4374.26 Denis Edwards, Judicial Review, the Precautionary Principle and the Protection of Habitats Do We Have a System of Administrative Law Yet? in id. at 209233.27 R Morge v Hampshire County Council 2009 EWHC 2940 Admin 2010 EWCA Civ 608 2011 UKSC 2.28 There is, of course, an argument to be made that courts concerns, especially at the higher levels of the judiciary, for settled institutional expectations, are very necessary and proper. This is the argument made in Andrew Waite, The Principle of Equilibrium in Environmental Law The Example of the Habitats Directive, in The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3 at 235251. It leads Waite to the conclusion that environmental protection laws, such as the Directives, will only succeed if they can accommodate proportionate economic growth. Id. at 250. In contrast, the other contributors to the book prioritize wildlife protection over regard for settled economic and institutional expectations, and their view of the success of the Directives is much more subdued, even negative.29 This is the major concern of George Graham, supra note 25.30 Id. at 5862 and 6670.31 The main effect of the ruling in Morge has been to weaken the UKs system of protection for EPS European protected species by removing the obligations upon local planning authorities to satisfy themselves before granting permission that a protected species would either not be disturbed, or that its disturbance would be lawfully licensed and by authorizing them to dispense with imposing a condition that the proposed activities be licensed before work can commence. It has thus removed what was previously a useful local mechanism for preventing harm to EPS, and has left only the criminal law ostensibly but not effectively enforced by Natural England to safeguard protected species from development. Id. at 7374.32 Again, this was most certainly not the case when the Directives were first adopted. In The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3, the organization of the chapters makes it difficult to bring all the key ambiguities into focus quickly. It is much easier to do this, however, in the maritime context, where implementation of the various provisions remains minimal and, therefore, very much a work in progress. See the quick review across the board of the key relevant ambiguities in Richard Cadell, The Maritime Dimensions of the Habitats Directive Past Challenges and Future Opportunities, in id. at 183207.33 The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3.34 Rebecca Clutten Isabella Tafur, Are Imperative Reasons Imperiling the Habitats Directive?

Poly 293 2010.59 As Edwards notes, the provisions of the Habitats Directive are implemented in the context of European treaty law. Article 1912 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU TFEU premises EU environmental policy on the need to provide a high level of protection for the environment, based in part on the precautionary principle and preventive action. These prescriptions, Edwards argues, ought to be binding on domestic courts, in which case they might facilitate substantive review. Although Article 1912 probably does not have direct effect, it is a prescriptive provision of the TFEU and, as such, is binding on domestic courts. This follows from Article 43 of the Treaty on European Union TEU ex Article 10 of the EC Treaty. Further, the new provision in Article 191 of the TEU, requiring Member States to provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law, arguably bolsters the established case under Article 43 TEU concerning the duties of domestic courts to ensure the full effectiveness of EU law even where EU law rules do not have direct effect citations omitted. Edwards, supra note 26 at 223224.60 Paul Stookes, The Habitats Directive Nature and Law, in The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3 at 149150. Precisely similar concerns lie behind Bradley Karkkainen, Toward a Smarter NEPA Monitoring and Managing Governments Environmental Performance, 102 Colum. L. Rev. 903 2002. Other disturbing aspects of enforcement are noted by Clutten and Tafur in their discussion of IROPI In relation to all the cases in which IROPI has been justified, compensatory measures will be put in place But there is nothing in Article 64, or in the Commission guidance of 2007 about how to implement the Article which requires the Commission to ensure that compensatory measures are actually taken. The Commission does not take action against Member States if they fail to implement the compensatory measures to which they have committed, even if a favorable opinion is given by the Commission on the basis of those measures being taken citation omitted.
