["Cite as Lilian Edwards and Michael Veale 2018 Enslaving the Algorithm From a Right to an Explanation to a Right to Better Decisions? IEEE Security ampamp Privacy 163, 4654, doi10.1109MSP.2018.2701152As concerns about unfairness and discrimination in black box machine learning systems rise, a legal right to an explanation has emerged as a compellingly attractive approach for challenge and redress. We outline recent debates on the limited provisions in European data protection law, and introduce and analyze newer explanation rights in French administrative law and the draft modernized Council of Europe Convention 108. While individual rights can be useful, in privacy law they have historically unreasonably burdened the average data subject.Meaningful information about algorithmic logics is more technically possible than commonly thought, but this exacerbates a new transparency fallacyan illusion of remedy rather than anything substantively helpful. While rightsbased approaches deserve a firm place in the toolbox, other forms of governance, such as impact assessments, soft law, judicial review, and model repositories deserve more attention, alongside catalyzing agencies acting for users to control algorithmic system design."]
