["The primary aim of the Swedish national population registration system is to obtain data that 1 reflect the composition, relationship and identities of the Swedish population and 2 can be used as the basis for correct decisions and measures by government and other regulatory authorities. For this purpose, Sweden has established two population registers 1 The Population Register, maintained by the Swedish National Tax Agency Folkbokf\u00f6ringsregistret and 2 The Total Population Register TPR maintained by the government agency Statistics Sweden Registret \u00f6ver totalbefolkningen. The registers contain data on life events including birth, death, name change, marital status, family relationships and migration within Sweden as well as to and from other countries. Updates are transmitted daily from the Tax Agency to the TPR. In this paper we describe the two population registers and analyse their strengths and weaknesses. Virtually 100 of births and deaths, 95 of immigrations and 91 of emigrations are reported to the Population Registers within 30 days and with a higher proportion over time. The overcoverage of the TPR, which is primarily due to underreported emigration data, has been estimated at up to 0.5 of the Swedish population. Through the personal identity number, assigned to all residents staying at least 1 year in Sweden, data from the TPR can be used for medical research purposes, including family design studies since each individual can be linked to his or her parents, siblings and offspring. The TPR also allows for identification of general population controls, participants in cohort studies, as well as calculation of followup time."]
