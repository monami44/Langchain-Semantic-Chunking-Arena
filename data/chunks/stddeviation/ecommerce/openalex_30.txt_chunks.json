["Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold first, to review and classify scientific publications dealing with those innovative solutions aimed at increasing the efficiency of lastmile delivery in business to consumer B2C ecommerce and, second, to outline directions for future research in this field. Designmethodologyapproach The review is based on 75 papers published between 2001 and 2019 in international peerreviewed journals or proceedings of conferences, retrieved from bibliographic databases and science search engines. Findings Due to its importance in affecting the overall logistics costs and, as a consequence, the economic sustainability of a B2C ecommerce initiative, lastmile delivery process deserves particular attention in order to be optimised. The review highlights that, among the main factors affecting its cost, there are the probability to have failed deliveries, the customer density in the delivery areas and the degree of automation of the process. Innovative and viable lastmile delivery solutions which may impact the mentioned drivers include parcel lockers, crowdsourcing logistics, mapping the consumer presence at home and dynamic pricing policies. Eventually, some gaps and areas for further research activities have been identified e.g. mapping customer behaviour, crowdsourcing logistics. Originalityvalue This review offers interesting insights to both academics and practitioners. On the academic side, it analyses and classifies relevant literature about innovative and efficiencyoriented lastmile delivery solutions, proposing directions for future research efforts. On the managerial side, it presents a holistic framework of the main factors affecting lastmile delivery cost and of viable innovative solutions that may be implemented to increase efficiency."]
