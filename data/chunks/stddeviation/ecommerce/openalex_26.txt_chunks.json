["In recent years, the boundaries between ecommerce and social networking have become increasingly blurred. Many ecommerce Web sites support the mechanism of social login where users can sign on the Web sites using their social network identities such as their Facebook or Twitter accounts. Users can also post their newly purchased products on microblogs with links to the ecommerce product Web pages. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for crosssite coldstart product recommendation, which aims to recommend products from ecommerce Web sites to users at social networking sites in coldstart situations, a problem which has rarely been explored before. A major challenge is how to leverage knowledge extracted from social networking sites for crosssite coldstart product recommendation. We propose to use the linked users across social networking sites and ecommerce Web sites users who have social networking accounts and have made purchases on ecommerce Web sites as a bridge to map users social networking features to another feature representation for product recommendation. In specific, we propose learning both users and products feature representations called user embeddings and product embeddings, respectively from data collected from ecommerce Web sites using recurrent neural networks and then apply a modified gradient boosting trees method to transform users social networking features into user embeddings. We then develop a featurebased matrix factorization approach which can leverage the learnt user embeddings for coldstart product recommendation. Experimental results on a large dataset constructed from the largest Chinese microblogging service Sina Weibo and the largest Chinese B2C ecommerce website JingDong have shown the effectiveness of our proposed framework."]
