["The rise of ecommerce has not only given consumers more choice but has also caused information overload. In order to quickly find favorite items from vast resources, users are eager for technology by which websites can automatically deliver items in which they may be interested. Thus, recommender systems are created and developed to automate the recommendation process. In the field of collaborative filtering recommendations, the accuracy requirement of the recommendation algorithm always makes it complex and difficult to implement one algorithm. The slope one algorithm is not only easy to implement but also works efficient and effective. However, the prediction accuracy of the slope one algorithm is not very high. Moreover, the slope one algorithm does not perform so well when dealing with personalized recommendation tasks that concern the relationship among users. To solve these problems, we propose a slope one algorithm based on the fusion of trusted data and user similarity, which can be deployed in various recommender systems. This algorithm comprises three procedures. First, we should select trusted data. Second, we should calculate the similarity between users. Third, we need to add this similarity to the weight factor of the improved slope one algorithm, and then, we get the final recommendation equation. We have carried out a number of experiments with the Amazon dataset, and the results prove that our recommender algorithm performs more accurately than the traditional slope one algorithm."]
