["Cryopreservation of reproductive material has dramatically improved clinical outcomes for patients all over the world. At the same time the practice has produced significant legal, ethical, and practical challenges to physicians and practices who use this technique. Failing to meet the expectations of patients, for example by losing material because of a freezer failure, has significant implications for the reproductive facility. Similarly, improperly transporting or receiving gametes or embryos can result in substantial risk to a practice. Perhaps the most widely publicized conundrum is how best to manage embryos that are abandoned. This paper will describe the legal principles and best practices that should be incorporated into the management of a fertility cryopreservation program.

However, the challenges and concerns accompanying all new technologies also apply to the cryopreservation of human reproductive tissue. There are inherent benefits and risks, not only associated with the freezing and thawing process itself but also involving actual and potential legal rights and obligations. There is no denying that gamete sperm and egg and embryo freezing have many benefits to patients, including preserving fertility for those facing fertilitycompromising medical treatment, optimizing pregnancy success by reducing ovarian hyperstimulation, decreasing the incidence of multiple pregnancies by storing supernumerary embryos for later use, decreasing cost and medical risk of subsequent IVF cycles, increasing the availability of donor gametes and embryos, and allowing time for genetic testing of embryos through preimplantation genetic testing 7Bosch E.

However, each of these indications for freezing raises the practical questions of how best to store, transport, and, ultimately, dispose of extraneous gametes and embryos while minimizing the risks that providing cryopreservation imposes on the healthcare provider and the fertility clinic. Clearly, the extensive use of cryopreservation in reproductive medicine has outpaced knowledge of the consequences of its use 9Bankowski B.J. Lyerly A.D.", "Faden R.R.", "Wallach E.E.

So it is not surprising that regulatory guidance regarding the storage, transport, and disposal of gametes and embryos is seen as disparate, vague, overreaching, or unfortunately, in some jurisdictions nonexistent. In the United States, for example, the federal government has a relatively small role in regulating technology such as cryopreservation 11Blake V.K. McGowan M.L.", "Levine A.D.

This article will review the various laws, legislative efforts, case law, and professional guidance that apply to storage, transport, and disposal of cryopreserved gametes and embryos. It will also discuss the potential risks and present practical considerations for developing working policies and procedures for the healthcare provider dealing with the daytoday issues of cryopreservation in the fertility clinic. Reproductive medicine and law cannot coexist without considering the ethical concerns raised by cryopreservation of gametes and embryos. Questions about status and value and rights are complex considerations when dealing with these issues 12Prescott D.E. Debele G.A.

Whereas the status of eggs and sperm appears to be somewhat less controversial, issues of value and ownership or control are often raised in instances where losses of irreplaceable gametes occur 14Letterie G, Fox D, Lawsuit frequency and claims basis over lost, damaged, and destroyed frozen embryos over a 10year period, Presented at the 75th Annual Meeting of the American Society Reproductive Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 1216, 2019.Google Scholar or the gamete contributor dies 15Bahadur G.

The emphasized language of the Louisiana statute embodies the mantel of protection that placed in that state on fertility providers when it comes to storing gametes and embryos. But first, one must consider whether this practice is even allowed under current law. Regulations vary worldwide from the generally unregulated landscape of North America to European countries where all but a few have regulations on ART 19CalhazJorge C. De Geyter C.", "Kupka M.

Where cryopreservation is routine, fertility clinics are cast as keepers of material that is full of hope and fraught with risks. Some of these risks include storage management, reduced or lost viability of specimens, rejection by gametes donors, and even contamination 6Alikani M. Parmegiani L. Human reproductive cell cryopreservation, storage, handling, and transport risks and risk management.Semin Reprod Med. 2018 36 265272Crossref PubMed Scopus 7 Google Scholar, and the associated costs. However, there are resources to assist in policy development to optimize the storage dilemma and reduce potential liabilities. The initial storage of gametes and embryos in fertility cliniclinked laboratories is by far the clearest of issues presented by the larger topic of human reproductive tissue cryostorage. Most fertility clinics are well aware of the necessity to follow professional guidelines that recommendand, in a few jurisdictions, regulatory guidelines that dictatethe use and maintenance of cryostorage tanks. With the recent exposure of several catastrophic gamete and embryo losses in the United States resulting from human error and cryotank failure 23Fox D. The legal limbo of lost embryos.httpsblog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu20190708thelegallimbooflostembryosDate accessed September 24, 2020Google Scholar, the field has become even more aware of its obligation to protect the tissue under its care. Today, there is a resurgence of directives aimed at avoiding unintentional or negligent losses of cryopreserved gametes. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have encouraged further regulation in the form of a standardized approach to ensure high standards of quality and safety regarding cryopreserved tissue, including reproductive tissue. The European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology, which provides professional guidelines, notes that most countries in the European Union EU have legislated assisted reproduction, many including specific regulations on cryostorage. For example, in Finland 24Ministry of Justice, FinlandAct on assisted fertility treatments 12372006, Section 24.httpswww.finlex.fienlakikaannokset2006en20061237.pdfDate accessed October 1, 2020Google Scholar and the United Kingdom 25Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Anyone who is involved in the procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of gametes, embryos or provide invitro fertilisation or artificial insemination treatments must obtain a license from the HFEA.Google Scholar, a facility must be licensed before cryostorage is allowed. Other countries may be moving in this direction. Responding to recent gamete and embryos losses in the United States, two states initiated legislation aimed at deterring similar risk events in the future. The New York State Department of Health issued standards for IVF laboratories that include inspections to ascertain that standards are met for the storage and handling of reproductive tissue, including requiring licensing requirements that dictate acceptable equipment and storage conditions and require adherence to relevant professional guidelines 26New York State Department of HealthExecutive summary of assisted reproductive technologies analysis and recommendations for public policy.httpswww.health.ny.govregulationstask_forcereports_publicationsexecsum.htmDate accessed November 5, 2020Google Scholar.

Aside from the few noted legislative efforts, the everyday care and storage of gametes and embryos in the United States is generally guided by standards set by professional organizations. The College of American Pathologists, which accredits ART laboratories, upon request provides checklists and reviews of some practices aimed at quality control for cryostorage, namely, monitoring liquid nitrogen levels within cryotanks and monitoring any alarm system that may be in use for such cryotanks 28College of American PathologistsAccreditation checklists.httpswww.cap.orglaboratoryimprovementaccreditationaccreditationchecklistsDate accessed November 5, 2020Google Scholar.

The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine ASRM recently provided more detailed guidance for cryostorage, which emphasized best practices, including limited access to cryostorage tanks, easily observed cryostorage rooms, adherence to manufacturers recommendations for cryotank use, quality control for liquid nitrogen and oxygen monitoring, cryostorage tank alarm systems, and storage tank inventories 30Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive MedicineCryostorage of reproductive tissues in the in vitro fertilization laboratory a committee opinion.Feril Steril. 2020 114 486491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus 5 Google Scholar. One of the predominant concerns regarding cryostorage of embryos revolves around the length of time that embryos may be stored. Questions of reduced viability over time continue to be expressed, even in the face of studies that prove otherwise 31Ueno S.", "Uchiyama K.", "Kuroda T. Yabuuchi A.

Various authors present embryo storage data in the United States from a 2002 survey as roughly 400,000 embryos cryopreserved and a 2011 survey noting 615,000 embryos cryopreserved. Arguably, a straight linear projection of an increase of roughly 50 over 9 years would hold that today there may be upwards of 900,000 embryos cryopreserved. This number, however, does not consider the use of new treatment protocols for reducing ovarian response and the creation of fewer embryos per cycle, nor the increasing use of oocyte freezing. Therefore, with a calculated 900,000 to 1,000,000 embryos currently in storage in the United States alone, storage limitations and final disposition arrangements are significant factors in establishing practical approaches to the fill gaps left by current regulations and guidelines. Cryostorage processes for sperm, eggs, and embryos inside the fertility clinic should address the potential known and foreseeable risks associated with cryopreservation, such as specimen loss due to equipment failure or human error, loss as a result of mislabeling, accidental destruction, reduced viability over time, crosscontamination of specimens, and staff safety 32Schiewe M.C.

General items to be included in the development of policies to manage cryostorage risk include the followingIdentifying the applicable cryostorage law, regulation, or judicial outcome and appropriate professional guidelines relevant to the clinics geographic area, and incorporating any requirements into practice.Surveying the location of cryopreservation storage units to evaluate for accessibility, safety, and security for maintaining tank integrity and temperature uniformity, which is necessary to protect cryopreserved material and staff.Ensuring that liquid or vapor nitrogen tanks are in good condition, operational, and stored properly in a wellventilated area. Oxygen monitors are strongly recommended.Developing routine cryopreservation equipment and tank management processes to include regular equipment and tank inspection, as well as repair and replacement based on manufacturers guidelines and standard industry usage.Installing locking and electronic monitoring systems on all cryopreservation storage tanks. This should include appropriate monitoring probe placement within the tanks, multiple alarm notification pathways, and backup energy supplies i.e., generators or batteries.Maintaining executed cryopreservation agreements with depositors that address cryopreservation processes, location and duration of storage, storage fees, depositors obligation to maintain contact, offsite transfer permission if applicable, and clear final disposition instructions.Developing protocols to reduce specimen loss during inventory e.g., consider automated identification and contamination during process and storage e.g., consider sterilization of liquid nitrogen and universal precautions.Addressing emergency and disaster responses, including staff safety, availability of first aid, cryostorage tank security, backup facilities, processes for closure andor movement of cryopreserved gametes and embryos to alternative locations as needed.Initial and periodic mandatory training of all embryology and andrology personnel on cryopreservation and cryostorage processes, policies, and procedures.

Transporting human tissue, including cryopreserved gametes and embryos, has become a growing business.

That does not necessarily mean that the transport is risk free or that the law of the intended transporting or receiving entitycountry allows such transfer. A serious consideration is the mode and method of gamete and embryo transport.

Moving embryos can be risky business for all parties, as was seen in a 2017 federal lawsuit when the embryos arrived at their destination in a nonviable state. The devastated intended parents sued for destruction of embryos resulting from improper shipping practices, including claims against the sending longterm storage facility party who packed the shipper, the shipping company employer of the worker who opened the container because he saw gas escaping, and the receiving fertility clinic party who unpacked the shipping container 40Lucio v.

As with cryostorage, regulations governing the transportation of gametes and embryos vary around the globe and are most easily divided into those that determine operational aspects of shipping and those that limit transport. An example of operational legislation is seen under the United Kingdoms Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority HFEA which has clearly stated rules for importing and exporting gametes and embryos.
