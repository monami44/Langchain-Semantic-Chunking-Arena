["In this paper we discuss the heritage of the WWII evacuation and the socalled burning of Lapland within a S\u00e1mi reindeer herding community, and assess how these wartime experiences have moulded, and continue to mould, the ways people memorialise and engage with the WWII material remains. Our focus is on the village of Vuotso, which is home to the southernmost S\u00e1mi community in Finland. The Nazi German troops established a large military base there in 1941, and the Germans and the villagers lived as close neighbours for several years.", "In 1944 the villagers were evacuated before the outbreak of the FinnoGerman Lapland War of 19441945, in which the German troops annihilated their military installations and the civilian infrastructure. Today the ruins of demolished German military installations persist around the village as vivid reminders, and act for the villagers as important active agents in memorising this vital phase in Laplands recent past. They also appear to facilitate nostalgia for the more independent days before traditional S\u00e1mi lifeways were ruptured by stronger Finnish State intervention in the postwar decades."]
