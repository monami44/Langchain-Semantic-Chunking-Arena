With SARSCoV2 N protein as a model target, a signalenhanced LFIA based on AuPt nanoparticles NPs as labels is proposed. This AuPt NPs combined the distinguished localized surface plasma resonance LSPR effect of Au NPs and the ultrahigh peroxidaselike catalytic activity of Pt NPs. AuPt NPs could trigger substrate chromogenic reaction, generating a color signal orders of magnitude darker than their intrinsic color. In the detection, after the coloration of the strips, 3,3,5,5tetramethylbenzidine TMB and H2O2 were added, and a dark blue chelate OxTMB was produced soon, enhancing the band color significantly. After the signal amplification, the nakedeye detection limit for N protein reached 40 pgmL. The detection sensitivity enhanced more than 1000 times than that without signal amplification. Compared with mainstream LFIA requiring complex readout instruments, the AuPtbased LFIA achieved a comparable sensitivity using naked eyes detection. This point is crucial, especially for unprofessional users or lowresource areas. Hence, this signalenhanced LFIA may serve as a sensitive, costeffective, and userfriendly detection method. It can shorten the testing window period and help identify early infections. 2024. The Authors, under exclusive licence to SpringerVerlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.
