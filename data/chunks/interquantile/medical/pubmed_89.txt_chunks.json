This study aims to understand availability of schoolbased infectious disease surveillance data e.g., COVID19 cases, student absences based on experiences during the COVID19 pandemic using a national sample of public K12 schools n 1,602. Based on surveys administered to school administrators throughout the 20212022 school year, we found high levels of missingness data for schoollevel COVID19 cases, quarantines, and student absenteeism, increasing missingness over time, and variations in missingness by school characteristics e.g., school size and protocols e.g., having a schoolbased system to report athome COVID19 tests. For the same sample of schools, using data requests to health departments, we found similarly high levels of missingness of schoollevel COVID19 case data and varying approaches in data collection. Developing nationally standardized case definitionsand systems to surveil or collect and monitor schoolbased infectious disease outcomes early in a public health emergencymay be helpful in producing actionable data.
