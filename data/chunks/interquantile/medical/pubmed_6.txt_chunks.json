OBJECTIVE To assess COVID19 vaccination prevalence and explore whether health beliefs were associated with vaccination among firefighters. METHODS A crosssectional online survey was distributed to Minnesota firefighters in March April 2022. Survey questions included demographics, vaccination status, and beliefs about COVID19 and vaccines. RESULTS Of the survey respondents N 974, 91 male, 89 White, 76 were fully vaccinated and 53 were boosted. Firefighters were less likely to be vaccinated if they reported more perceived barriers OR 0.42, p .001, greater decisionmaking ease OR 0.42, p .001, and greater autonomy OR 0.65, p .04. Greater perceived benefits OR 2.63, p .001 and social norms OR 2.10, p .001 were associated with a greater likelihood of being vaccinated. Similar results were seen predicting booster status. CONCLUSIONS Firefighters had similar vaccination rates as the general population, despite high exposure risks. Health beliefs are strongly related to vaccination status.
