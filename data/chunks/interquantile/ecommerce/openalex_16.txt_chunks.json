["The rise of the internet is often associated with the death of distance or at least the decreasing relevance of geographical distance in the supply of information. We investigate whether distance still matters for online trade in physical goods. We use data from an online consumer survey panel on online crossborder trade in goods in a linguistically fragmented EU market. The analysis confirms that distancerelated trade costs are greatly reduced compared to offline trade in the same goods. However, languagerelated trade costs increase. Moreover, online trade introduces new sources of trade costs such as parcel delivery and online payments systems. On balance, there are no indications that online trade is less biased in favour of home market products than offline trade. We examine options available to policy makers to boost crossborder ecommerce in the EU Digital Single Market. A 1 increase in the use of efficient and flexible crossborder payment systems could increase crossborder ecommerce by as much as 7. We also show that online trade gives a comparative advantage to Englishlanguage exporting countries."]
