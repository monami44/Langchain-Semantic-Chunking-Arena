["The COVID19 pandemic has disrupted retail and accelerated the trend towards electronic commerce. This study explores the reasons for and the implications of this shift. Our study builds on the consumer behavior literature, emerging COVID19 research, and the environmentally imposed constraints perspective to describe how online purchasing behavior evolved during the COVID19 crisis. The objective is to better understand how consumers use ecommerce to react to, cope with and adapt to periods of environmentally imposed constraints. Based on multiple sources including transaction and search data from a major French online retailer, we describe how consumer behavior evolves during such stressful life events as COVID19. Our results support the usefulness of the multiperspective reactcopeadapt framework of constrained consumer behavior in an online environment."]
