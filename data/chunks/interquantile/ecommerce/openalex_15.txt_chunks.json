["In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet technology, online shopping has become a mainstream way for users to purchase and consume. Sentiment analysis of a large number of user reviews on ecommerce platforms can effectively improve user satisfaction. This paper proposes a new sentiment analysis modelSLCABG, which is based on the sentiment lexicon and combines Convolutional Neural Network CNN and attentionbased Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit BiGRU. In terms of methods, the SLCABG model combines the advantages of sentiment lexicon and deep learning technology, and overcomes the shortcomings of existing sentiment analysis model of product reviews. The SLCABG model combines the advantages of the sentiment lexicon and deep learning techniques. First, the sentiment lexicon is used to enhance the sentiment features in the reviews. Then the CNN and the Gated Recurrent Unit GRU network are used to extract the main sentiment features and context features in the reviews and use the attention mechanism to weight. And finally classify the weighted sentiment features. In terms of data, this paper crawls and cleans the real book evaluation of dangdang.com, a famous Chinese ecommerce website, for training and testing, all of which are based on Chinese. The scale of the data has reached 100000 orders of magnitude, which can be widely used in the field of Chinese sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that the model can effectively improve the performance of text sentiment analysis."]
