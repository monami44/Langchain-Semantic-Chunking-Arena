["The advent and incorporation of technology in businesses have reformed operations across industries.", "Notably, major technical shifts in ecommerce aim to influence customer behavior in favor of some products and brands. Artificial intelligence AI comes on board as an essential innovative tool for personalization and customizing products to meet specific demands. This research finds that, despite the contribution of AI systems in ecommerce, its ethical soundness is a contentious issue, especially regarding the concept of explainability. The study adopted the use of word cloud analysis, voyance analysis, and concordance analysis to gain a detailed understanding of the idea of explainability as has been utilized by researchers in the context of AI. Motivated by a corpus analysis, this research lays the groundwork for a uniform front, thus contributing to a scientific breakthrough that seeks to formulate Explainable Artificial Intelligence XAI models. XAI is a machine learning field that inspects and tries to understand the models and steps involved in how the black box decisions of AI systems are made it provides insights into the decision points, variables, and data used to make a recommendation. This study suggested that, to deploy explainable XAI systems, ML models should be improved, making them interpretable and comprehensible."]
