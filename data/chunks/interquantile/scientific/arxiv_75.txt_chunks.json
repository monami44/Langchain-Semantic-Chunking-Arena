["TF.Learn is a highlevel Python module for distributed machine learning inside TensorFlow. It provides an easytouse Scikitlearn style interface to simplify the process of creating, configuring, training, evaluating, and experimenting a machine learning model. TF.Learn integrates a wide range of stateofart machine learning algorithms built on top of TensorFlows low level APIs for small to largescale supervised and unsupervised problems. This module focuses on bringing machine learning to nonspecialists using a generalpurpose highlevel language as well as researchers who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment. Emphasis is put on ease of use, performance, documentation, and API consistency."]
