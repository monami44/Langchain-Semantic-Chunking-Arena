["This paper provides a first study of utilizing energy harvesting for sustainable machine learning in distributed networks. We consider a distributed learning setup in which a machine learning model is trained over a large number of devices that can harvest energy from the ambient environment, and develop a practical learning framework with theoretical convergence guarantees. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the proposed framework can significantly outperform energyagnostic benchmarks. Our framework is scalable, requires only local estimation of the energy statistics, and can be applied to a wide range of distributed training settings, including machine learning in wireless networks, edge computing, and mobile internet of things."]
