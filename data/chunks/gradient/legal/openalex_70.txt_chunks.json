As a method of scientific research, it plays an extremely important role in learning the essence of social phenomena and processes. The expediency of the raised topic is stated as one of the universal methods in the plan of transforming the future, because it is impossible to carry out social transformations without having a proper innovative project.

Considering the above, it is relevant to review the current and future steps taken regarding this adaptation.
