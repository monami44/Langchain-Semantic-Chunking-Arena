["The paper deals with the recent WeissPSPP decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the German Federal Constitutional Court, attempting to contextualise these decisions within previous conflicts between these two courts. The FCCs case law is studied through the perspective of three different types of reviews it developed fundamental rights review, ultra vires review and constitutional identity review.", "Then, a detailed analysis of the Weiss and PSPP cases is given in order to understand the repercussions of the first case in which the FCC officially exercised its proclaimed competences and declared the CJEU and ECBs decisions as ultra vires, undermining fundamental principles of the EU legal order. This act could potentially lead to significant changes in current mechanisms of resolving disputes between the highest courts of the EU and national legal orders. Finally, the future of judicial conflicts is discussed through the analysis of the WeilerSarmiento model and the system or lack of system of resolving the conflicts currently in place. The paper concludes by highlighting that the WeissPSPP decisions could very well be those that finally stimulate a longneeded solution.
