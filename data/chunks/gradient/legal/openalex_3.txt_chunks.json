["Abstract The EUs Common Foreign and Security Policy CFSP was conceived of as an area illsuited for full judicial review by the Court of Justice of the European Union.", "The Lisbon Treaty confers on the Court limited jurisdiction which the recent case law has interpreted in broad terms. This article will place this case law in the broader constitutional setting of the EU legal order and will provide a critical analysis of its implications for both the EUs and domestic courts. The analysis is structured on the basis of three main themes. The first is about the position of CFSP in the EUs constitutional architecture the article will analyse the constitutional ambivalence that characterizes this position and how it is conveyed by the provisions of the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union governing the Courts jurisdiction. The second theme is about the recent case law, and the integrationist approach that the Court of Justice has adopted to the scope of its jurisdiction. The third theme is about national courts the article will argue that recent case law has been too quick to dismiss them, and that primary law renders them an essential part of the judicial review system governing CFSP."]
