["The quantum dynamic equation QDE of machine learning is obtained based on Schrodinger equation and potential energy equivalence relationship.", "Through Wick rotation, the relationship between quantum dynamics and thermodynamics is also established in this paper. This equation reformulates the iterative process of machine learning into a timedependent partial differential equation with a clear mathematical structure, offering a theoretical framework for investigating machine learning iterations through quantum and mathematical theories. Within this framework, the fundamental iterative process, the diffusion model, and the Softmax and Sigmoid functions are examined, validating the proposed quantum dynamics equations. This approach not only presents a rigorous theoretical foundation for machine learning but also holds promise for supporting the implementation of machine learning algorithms on quantum computers."]
