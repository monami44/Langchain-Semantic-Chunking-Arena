["Machine learning has more and more effect on our every days life. This field keeps growing and expanding into new areas.", "Machine learning is based on the implementation of artificial intelligence that gives systems the capability to automatically learn and enhance from experiments without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning algorithms apply mathematical equations to analyze datasets and predict values based on the dataset. In the field of cybersecurity, machine learning algorithms can be utilized to train and analyze the Intrusion Detection Systems IDSs on securityrelated datasets. In this paper, we tested different machine learning algorithms to analyze NSLKDD dataset using KNIME analytics."]
