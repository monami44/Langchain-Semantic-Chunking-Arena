["Crossborder ecommerce is becoming increasingly popular around the world. With the development of technology, competition has gradually shifted from commoditybased attributes, such as cost and quality, to a supply chains service capacity for ecommerce. Within this context, the present paper delineates how crossborder ecommerce firms can generate supply chain service capabilities that yield improvements in supply chain relationship quality to etailors and other platform users. Insights are derived through data collected via a multiple case study approach based on four Chinese crossborder ecommerce enterprises OSell, Zongteng, BizArk and Linca data were collected from 41 semistructured interviews, field visits and secondary data. Relying on the servicedominant logic as the theoretical foundation, we identify three supply chain resources flows related to information, logistics and finance and their interplay as being critical for the development of supply chain service capabilities, which in turn lead to an improvement in the quality of supply chain relationships assessed by the dimensions of trust improvementcommitment, risk mitigation, and customer satisfaction.", "The results offer important insights into how to best manage supply chain resources in relation to the three flows by crossborder ecommerce firms in order to foster relationship quality, an attribute that has become so critical today for competitive differentiation."]
