["Building on the resourcebased view RBV perspective of the firm and firms competitive capabilities, this study examines the digital export drivers as means for firms to exploit opportunities brought about by digital technologies in their B2C digital marketing activities. By leveraging a unique dataset covering 102 Italybased firms of different sizes small, medium, and large, active in three different sectors design and furniture, fashion, and food and beverage, this work examines the role of firm resources to support internationalization via digital channels. We find that 1 SMEs do not suffer from a weaker propensity to engage with digital export despite resources constraints 2 firms leveraging digital technologies are more likely to enhance their digital export, regardless of firm size 3 digital capabilities are critical as firms employing an ecommerce manager have a higher propensity to undertake digital export than firms relying on a traditional export manager, regardless of firm size."]
