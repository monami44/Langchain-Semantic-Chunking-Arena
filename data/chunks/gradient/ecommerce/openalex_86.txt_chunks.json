Therefore, how to promote consumer online shopping is the most important goal for crossborder ecommerce sustainability. Meanwhile, the previous research has not empirically verified the precise effect of online shopping context and perceived value on consumers crossborder online purchase intention. To address this gap, this study analyzes the online shopping context that determines consumers purchase intention and innovatively identifies four cues that promote this consumption behavior in crossborder ecommerce, such as online promotion cues, content marketing cues, personalized recommendation cues, and social review cues. It proposes a theoretical model based on cue utilization theory and stimulusorganismresponse model, which introduces this four cues and brand familiarity in analyzing the effects on consumers purchase intention in crossborder online shopping CBOS.", "In addition, the paper examines the mediating role of perceived functional value and perceived emotional value. Survey data collected 372 crossborder online consumers from China and the PLSSEM method was used to empirically test the proposed model. The results show that these four crossborder online shopping context cues have a significantly positive impact on consumers purchase intention. Brand familiarity has significantly negative moderating effects between the four cues and the perceived functional value, while brand familiarity also negatively moderates the relationship between online promotion cues, social review cues, and perceived emotional value, respectively."]
