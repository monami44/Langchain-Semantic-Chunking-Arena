["In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution 4IR or Industry 4.0, the digital world has a wealth of data, such as Internet of Things IoT data, cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media data, health data, etc. To intelligently analyze these data and develop the corresponding smart and automated applications, the knowledge of artificial intelligence AI, particularly, machine learning ML is the key. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, this studys key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various realworld application domains, such as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, ecommerce, agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and potential research directions based on our study.", "Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals as well as for decisionmakers in various realworld situations and application areas, particularly from the technical point of view."]
