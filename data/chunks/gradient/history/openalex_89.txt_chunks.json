["Bone samples may yield lowquality and lowquantity DNA and duplicated analyses of different genetic markers have to be performed for identification of missing persons.", "Mostly no DNA extract is left after analyses and efficient storage of bones is needed to ensure the stability of the sample over time for retesting using new markers and new technologies. Usually not all of the bone powder prepared in grinder is used for extraction and rest can be stored for future analyses. After molecular genetic analyses of 88 victims of Second World War WWII Konfin I mass grave in Slovenia performed in 2009, fragments of femurs and bone powder that were left were stored at 20 C. Some authors reported that longterm storage of powder results in the reduction of DNA preservation and its degradation even at low temperature, explained by an increase in oxidative damage as a result of the enormous increase in exposed surface area. Consequently, grinding of bones as shortly prior to DNA extraction was recommended. The goal of our study was to explore the difference in DNA yield between bone fragment and bone powder frozen for 10 years. 57 WWII femurs were examined and DNA extracted from each of them using bone fragment piece sampled next to the one used in 2009 and bone powder obtained in 2009, both taken out of freezer after 10 years of storage. Half gram of bone powder was decalcified using full demineralization extraction method. The DNA was purified in a Biorobot EZ1 Qiagen and quantified with PowerQuant kit Promega. Statistical analysis showed significant difference at the 0.05 level in DNA yield comparing fragments of bones and bone powder stored at 20 C for 10 years. The results show there is more DNA stored in the bone powder than in the bone fragments. Because of time consuming powdering procedure we recommend to store not only the fragment of the bone, but obtained bone powder as well."]
