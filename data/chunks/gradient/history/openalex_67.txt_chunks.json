["South Africa\u00e2s entry into the Second World War in 1939 was complex.", "The Smuts government lacked nationwide support and experienced hostile reactions from opponents of its war policy. It was also subjected to Nazi propaganda offensives, which intensified national divisions and undermined public morale. In response, the Union authorities adopted a volunteer policy for military service and embarked on a massive drive to secure positive public opinion and national support for the war policy. This move led to the establishment of various publicity and propaganda organisations to influence public opinion and to stimulate enthusiasm for the war. However, inadequate policy direction and lacking a solid framework to guide propaganda organisation and operations created interagency frictions and rivalries. The study on which this article is based, examined the main propaganda agencies, the Bureau of Information BOI, the Directorate of Military Intelligence DMI and the Union Unity Truth Service UUTS, which contested one another for jurisdiction, authority and power to shape public opinion in South Africa during the war. The analysis focused on the rationale for their establishment, their purpose, objectives and activities. Then the article reports on the interinstitutional relationships, organisational politics and competition, and how these aspects affected the Union\u00e2s propaganda enterprise, mobilisation drive and the prosecution of the war effort."]
