["Abstract The article focuses on five essential phenomena in the Finnish memory culture relating to the three Finnish wars fought in 19391945, namely, 1 the memory of the fallen 2 the influential work by author V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna 3 the contested memory politics and veteran cultures in the 1960s and 1970s 4 Germany and the Holocaust in the Finnish memory culture and 5 the neopatriotic turn in the commemoration of the wars from the end of the 1980s onwards. The Finnish memory culture of 19391945 presents an interesting case of how the de facto lost wars against the Soviet Union have been shaped into cornerstones of national history and identity that continue to play a significant role even today. Using the growing research literature on the various aspects of the Finnish war memories and memory politics, the article aims, first, at outlining a synthesis of the memory cultures central features and, second, at challenging the common contemporary conception, according to which the Finnish war veterans would have been forgotten, neglected and even disgraced during the postwar decades, to be rehabilitated only from the end of the 1980s onwards.

Parallel and interlinked with the finishing of this article a concise English presentation on the Finnish memory culture of war has been written by Tiina Kinnunen and Markku Jokisipil\u00e4, Shifting Images of Our Wars. 2 Stenius, \u00d6sterberg, and \u00d6stling, Nordic Narratives. 3 See Jokisipil\u00e4, Finnish History Culture Meinander, A Separate Story? and Kivim\u00e4ki, Three Wars and Their Epitaphs. 4 During the Continuation War, Finland occupied large areas of Soviet Eastern Karelia. Whereas the Winter War and the Continuation War were fullscale conflicts, the Lapland War against Germany was largely fought with reduced conscript units after the army was demobilized in November 1944.

Military casualties of the Winter War, Continuation War and Lapland War were, respectively, ca. 27,000, 63,000, and 3,000 men. 11 Some of these, such as the Patriotic Peoples Movement party, were truly fascist, while some, such as the Academic Karelia Society, were at least chauvinistic. But the ban also included war veteran and national defence organizations, which most Finns could hardly see as fascist, and which would be better labelled as national conservative. 12 Marshal Mannerheim, who had also been the commanderinchief of the White troops in 1918, remained, of course, a highly controversial figure in Finland.

The Finnish Peoples Democratic League, including the Communist Party candidates, received 23.5 of the vote and became the second largest party after the Social Democratic Party.", "21 Niemi, Viime sotien kirjat, 12533 cf.", "Jokinen, Myytti sodan palveluksessa, 1413. 22 Varpio, V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linnan el\u00e4m\u00e4, 3525. 23 Niemi, Viime sotien kirjat, 13033 Varpio, V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linnan el\u00e4m\u00e4, 271, 30117, 375 this national meaning of the war is emphasized in Edvin Laines film, which ends with Finnish soldiers burying their comrade, with the Finlandia hymn by Jean Sibelius playing in the background.

It is telling that this film is rarely shown on television, and the Independence Day spectacle is reserved for Edvin Laines less violent and more patriotic version. 27 Varpio, V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linnan el\u00e4m\u00e4, 294, 64046 on the myth of war experience and Finnish masculinity, see Ahlb\u00e4ck and Kivim\u00e4ki, Masculinities at War, 1267. 28 Kettunen, Tuntematon sotilas, 119. 29 See Kinnunen and Jokisipil\u00e4, Shifting Images, 4478. 30 Vihavainen, Kansakunta r\u00e4hm\u00e4ll\u00e4\u00e4n, 2225. 31 See, e.g., Juuj\u00e4rvi, Pesso, and Salin, Sotiemme veteraanien identiteetti, 2632, 759. 32 Cf.

At the same time in the 1960s, the abovementioned lotta debate was also revisited, as the novel Sissiluutnantti 1963 by Paavo Rintala again raised questions of lottas reputation and honour Kinnunen, Gender and Politics, 1935. 34 See, e.g., Herzog, Sex after Fascism. 35 Sulamaa, Himmet\u00e4 ei muistot koskaan saa, 297311. 36 Ukkola, Sodan j\u00e4lkeen, 35. 37 On the term neopatriotism in this context, see Vares, Kuitenkin me voitimme!. 38 Sulamaa, Veteraania ei j\u00e4tet\u00e4, 4363 Tuomisto, Etulinjassa, 100140. 39 Miettunen, Menneisyys ja historiakuva, passim. 40 Apparently, the Soviet authorities considered the magazine as revanchist, but this did not disturb its publication Rautkallio, Politik und Volk, 206.", "41 Sulamaa, Himmet\u00e4 ei muistot koskaan saa, 3023 editorial, Kansa taisteli, no. 5 1986 147. 42 On the Finnish readership of war literature until the end of 1980s, Niemi, Viime sotien kirjat, 194203. 43 From 1945 until the 1970s, the social democrats and the peoples democrats gained about 45 of the vote in national elections today, the comparable share of the left is less than 30. 44 A division into bourgeois and workingclass unions would only be true as a general characterization. In practice, both unions tended to lean towards the centre and the local differences between the unions were often quite unclear and complicated, see Sulamaa, Veteraania ei j\u00e4tet\u00e4, 402, 1919 Tuomisto, Etulinjassa, 838, 11317. 45 These key war veteran figures, close to President Kekkonen and active in the Finnish foreign policy of the 1970s, included, for instance, longtime prime and foreign minister Ahti Karjalainen, twotime prime minister and later president Mauno Koivisto, and foreign minister albeit for a rather short period V\u00e4in\u00f6 Leskinen. 46 The complexity of the issue can be illustrated by the fact that probably the two most despised Finnish politicians among the hardcore communist youth radicals of the 1970s were indeed war veterans, Aarne Saarinen and Ele Alenius, but Saarinen also happened to be the chairman of the Finnish Communist Party and Alenius the leader of the peoples democrats. Eino S. Repo, the head of the Finnish Broadcasting Company in the 1960s and allegedly responsible for its radicalization, had also been a frontline officer. 47 Juuj\u00e4rvi, Pesso, and Salin, Sotiemme veteraanien identiteetti, 846. 48 Jokisipil\u00e4, Kappas vaan, saksalaisia this debate is so longlasting and nuanced that it is not fruitful to describe it here in detail for summaries in German and English, see Kinnunen, Finnische Kriegserinnerung Meinander, A Separate Story Jokisipil\u00e4, Finnish History Culture and Kivim\u00e4ki, Three Wars and Their Epitaphs. 49 Junila, Kotirintaman aseveljeytt\u00e4, 312, 82, 13646, 286304. 50 Jokisipil\u00e4, Asevelji\u00e4 vai liittolaisia, 3616. 51 Ahto, Aseveljet vastakkain, 67, 21526 Junila, Kotirintaman aseveljeytt\u00e4, 623, 82. 52 As described in the abovecited title of Sampo Ahtos history of the Lapland War, Aseveljet vastakkain, which translates as brothersinarms against each other. 53 This is also true regarding the wartime resistance movement during the Continuation War, a few Finnish communists did organize some minor sabotages, but they remained practically irrelevant. 54 Vares, Kuitenkin me voitimme, 184. 55 Rautkallio, Politik und Volk, 21417. Some Finnish Jews who served in contact with German troops were even awarded the Iron Cross, and the German military was surprised to learn that the Finnish Army in Eastern Karelia had established a field synagogue for its Jewish soldiers.

The connection of the present Finnish memory culture of war to the growing populist rightwing sentiment would definitely require a study of its own. 67 Raivo, This Is Where They Fought, 15963. 68 Meinander, Suomi 1944, 3958. 69 Aamulehti, 28 November 2009. 70 Meinander, A Separate Story?, 714. 71 Torsti, Suomalaisten moniulotteiset sotakuvat. 72 See Str\u00e5th, Nordic Foundation Myths, 1648. 73 On the troubles of including this European memory trend into the Finnish memory culture, see Silvennoinen, Still Under Examination Holmila, Varieties of Silence. 74 See, e.g., Bucur, Heroes and Victims, passim Ungv\u00e1ry, The Siege of Budapest, 357. 75 On the political uses of wartime history and memory, see Torsti, Suomalaisten moniulotteiset sotakuvat, 3223. 76 As the war veterans now have a special status as a moral authority, we have already seen individual veterans opinions, or wholly imagined and generalized veteran opinion, mobilized to oppose a multitude of issues, such as contemporary art and theatre performances, the selling of land property to Russians, refugee and immigration policies, the compulsory teaching of Swedish language at schools, and lately also gays dancing at the presidents annual Independence Day reception, to name just a few examples. Furthermore, during the present economic crisis the Spirit of the Winter War has been called forth to support national consensus at the face of economic austerity and budget cuts."]
