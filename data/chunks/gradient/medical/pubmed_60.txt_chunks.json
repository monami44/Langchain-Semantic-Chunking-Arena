BACKGROUND We conducted the first noninferiority, randomised controlled trial to determine whether lifestyle therapy is noninferior to psychotherapy with respect to mental health outcomes and costs when delivered via online videoconferencing. METHODS An individually randomised, group treatment design with computergenerated block randomisation was used. Between May 2021April 2022, 182 adults with a Distress Questionnaire5 score 8 indicative depression were recruited from a tertiary mental health service in regional Victoria, Australia and surrounds. Participants were assigned to six 90min sessions over 8weeks using groupbased, online videoconferencing comprising 1 lifestyle therapy targeting nutrition, physical activity with a dietitian and exercise physiologist n 91 or 2 psychotherapy Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with psychologists n 91. The primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire9 PHQ9 depression at 8weeks noninferiority margin 2 using Generalised Estimating Equations GEE. Costminimisation analysis estimated the mean difference in total costs from health sector and societal perspectives. Outcomes were assessed by blinded research assistants using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews. Results are presented perprotocol PP and Intention to Treat ITT using beta coefficients with 95 Confidence Intervals CIs. FINDINGS The sample was 80 women mean 45years SD13.4, mean PHQ910.5 SD5.7. An average 4.2 of 6 sessions were completed, with complete data for n 132. Over 8weeks, depression reduced in both arms PP Lifestyle n 70 mean difference3.97, 95 CIs5.10, 2.84 and Psychotherapy n 62 mean difference3.74, 95 CIs5.12, 2.37 ITT Lifestyle n 91 mean difference4.42, 95 CIs 4.59, 4.25 Psychotherapy n 91 mean difference3.82, 95 CIs4.05, 3.69 with evidence of noninferiority PP GEE \u03b20.59 95 CIs1.87, 0.70, n 132 ITT GEE \u03b20.49, 95 CIs1.73, 0.75, n 182. Three serious adverse events were recorded. While lifestyle therapy was delivered at lower cost, there were no differences in total costs health sector adjusted mean difference PP AUD156 95 CIs 182, 611, ITT AUD190 95 CIs 155, 651 societal adjusted mean difference PP AUD350 95 CIs222, 1152 ITT AUD 408 95 CIs 139, 1157. INTERPRETATION Remotedelivered lifestyle therapy was noninferior to psychotherapy with respect to clinical and cost outcomes. If replicated in a fully powered RCT, this approach could increase access to allied health professionals who, with adequate training and guidelines, can deliver mental healthcare at comparable cost to psychologists.
