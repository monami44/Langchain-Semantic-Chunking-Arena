OBJECTIVE To address the complexities of distinguishing truth from falsehood in the context of the COVID19 infodemic, this paper focuses on utilizing deep learning models for infodemic ternary classification detection. METHODS Eight commonly used deep learning models are employed to categorize collected records as true, false, or uncertain. These models include fastText, three models based on recurrent neural networks, two models based on convolutional neural networks, and two transformerbased models. RESULTS Precision, recall, and F1score metrics for each category, along with overall accuracy, are presented to establish benchmark results. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the confusion matrix is conducted to provide insights into the models performance. CONCLUSION Given the limited availability of infodemic records and the relatively modest size of the two tested data sets, models with pretrained embeddings or simpler architectures tend to outperform their more complex counterparts. This highlights the potential efficiency of pretrained or simpler models for ternary classification in COVID19 infodemic detection and underscores the need for further research in this area.
