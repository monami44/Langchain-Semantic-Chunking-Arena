Nucleic acidbased vaccines allow scalable, rapid, and cellfree vaccine production in response to an emerging disease such as the current COVID19 pandemic. Here, we objected to the design of a multiepitope mRNA vaccine against the structural proteins of SARSCoV2. Through an immunoinformatic approach, promising epitopes were predicted for the spike S, envelope E, membrane M, and nucleocapsid N proteins. Fragments rich in overlapping epitopes were selected based on binding affinities with HLA classes I and II for the specific presentation to B and T lymphocytes. Two constructs were designed by fusing the fragments in different arrangements via GG linkers. Construct 1 showed better structural properties and interactions with tolllike receptor 2 TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 during molecular docking and dynamic simulation. A 50S ribosomal L7L12 adjuvant was added to its Nterminus to improve stability and immunogenicity. The final RNA sequence was used to design a transamplifying RNA taRNA vaccine in a splitvector system. It consists of two molecules a nonreplicating RNA encoding a transacting replicase to amplify the second one, a transreplicon TR RNA encoding the vaccine protein. Overall, the immune response simulation detected that activated B and T lymphocytes and increased memory cell formation. Macrophages and dendritic cells proliferated continuously, and IFN\u03b3 and cytokines like IL2 were released highly. Copyright 2024 Fatemeh Nafian et al.
