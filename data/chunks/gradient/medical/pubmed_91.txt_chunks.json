However, data describing peripheral venous catheter associated bloodstream infections PVCBSI are limited. AIMS To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for PVCBSI during the COVID19 pandemic. METHODS We conducted retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected PVCBSI data in a 2100 bed hospital network in Switzerland. Adult patients with a PVC inserted between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 were included. Risk factors for PVCBSI were identified through descriptive analysis of patient and catheter characteristics, and univariable marginal Cox models. RESULTS 206,804 PVCs and 37 PVCBSI were analysed. Most PVCBSI were attributed to catheters inserted in the Emergency department 76 or surgical wards 22. PVCBSI increased in 2021 compared to 2020 hazard ratio 2021 vs. 2020 2.73 95 confidence interval 1.196.29, with a numerically higher rate of Staphylococcus aureus 110, 10, vs. 527, 19 and polymicrobial infection 010, 0 vs. 427, 15. PVC insertions, patient characteristics, and catheter characteristics remained similar across the study period. PVCBSI risk was associated with admission to the intensive care unit ICU, and use of wide gauge catheter 16G. CONCLUSION Increased PVCBSI during the COVID19 pandemic was not explained by catheter or patient factors alone, and may result from systemwide changes. PVCBSI events are primarily attributed to acute care settings, including the emergency department, surgical wards, and the ICU.", "2024. The Authors.
