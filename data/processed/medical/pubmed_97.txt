BACKGROUND Common cold coronaviruses ccCoVs and influenza virus are common infectious agents causing upper respiratory tract infections RTIs. However, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and health effects of ccCoV infection remain understudied. METHODS A retrospective study evaluated 3,935 outpatients with acute upper RTI at a tertiary teaching hospital. The presence of ccCoV and influenza virus was determined by multiplex molecular assay. The demographic, clinical symptoms, and health outcomes were compared between patients with ccCoV n 205 and influenza n 417 infections. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to evaluate predictors and health outcomes over a oneyear followup. RESULTS Sore throat, nasal discharge, headache, and myalgia were more predominant in ccCoV infection fever was common in influenza. Most patients reported moderate symptoms severity 49.8 ccCoV, 56.1 influenza. Subsequent primary care visits with symptoms of RTI within a year were comparable for both infections 27.3 ccCoV vs. 27.6 influenza. However, patients with influenza reported increased primary care visits for nonRTI episodes and allcause hospital admission. Baseline comorbidities were associated with increased primary care visits with symptoms of RTI in either ccCoV adjusted odds ratio aOR 2.5 95 confidence interval CI 1.15.9 P 0.034 or influenza OR 1.9 95 CI 1.13.1 P 0.017 infections, due probably to the dysregulation of the host immune response following acute infections. In patients infected with influenza infection, dyslipidemia was a predictor for subsequent primary care visits with symptoms of RTI unadjusted OR 1.8 95 CI 1.03.0 P 0.040. CONCLUSIONS Both influenza and ccCoV infection pose significant disease burden, especially in patients with comorbidities. The management of comorbidities should be prioritized to mitigate poor health outcomes in infected individuals. 2024. The Authors. DOI 10.1186s12985024025246 PMID 39380036 Indexed for MEDLINE
