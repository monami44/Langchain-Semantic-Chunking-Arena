BACKGROUND Understanding the facilitators, barriers and hesitancy to accepting COVID19 booster doses is important for encouraging recommended vaccination. This evidence brief summarizes literature on the intention to accept or reject COVID19 vaccine booster doses and the factors associated with intentionuptake among individuals in Canada. METHODS A database of COVID19 literature established at the Public Health Agency of Canada was searched for articles referencing vaccination and knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards COVID19 boosters. A grey literature search of Canadian governmental and academic institutions was also conducted. Primary research conducted in Canada n21 and relevant systematic reviews of the global literature n8 were included in this evidence brief. RESULTS Intentions to get a booster dose in the general population have decreased between 20212023, with intentions varying across subpopulations. In Canada and within the global systematic reviews, facilitators, barriers and hesitancy were similar. Older age was the most common factor positively associated with intentionuptake of a booster, and the most common motivators were governmenthealthcare provider recommendations and helping to protect others. The main reasons for hesitancy were concerns about vaccine side effects and a lack of belief in the vaccines efficacy. CONCLUSION Intentions to get a booster dose have decreased in Canada. Understanding the reasons for vaccine hesitancy and motivators for obtaining a booster can help guide future public health COVID19 booster vaccination programs.
