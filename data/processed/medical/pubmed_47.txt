OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether there were differences in the presentation of patients with tubal ectopic pregnancy EP during the first year of the COVID19 pandemic. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of all cases of tubal EP between March 2019 and March 2020 prepandemic and between March 2020 and March 2021 pandemic. We compared between these two groups the risk factors, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, sonographic aspects, treatment applied and complications. RESULTS We had 150 EP diagnoses during the two years studied, of which 135 were tubal EP. Of these, 65 were included in the prepandemic and 70 in the pandemic period. The prevalence of lower abdominal pain was significantly higher in the pandemic compared to the prepandemic period 91.4 vs. 78.1, p0.031. There was no significant difference in shock index, initial betahCG level, hemoglobin level at diagnosis, days of menstrual delay, aspect of the adnexal mass, amount of free fluid on ultrasound, and intact or ruptured presentation between the groups. Expectant management was significantly higher during the pandemic period 40.0 vs. 18.5, p0.008, surgical management was lower during the pandemic period 47.1 vs. 67.7, p0.023, and number of days hospitalized was lower in the pandemic period 1.3 vs. 2.0 days, p0.003. CONCLUSION We did not observe a significant difference in patient history, laboratory and ultrasound characteristics. Abdominal pain was more common during the pandemic period. Regarding treatment, we observed a significant increase in expectant and a decrease in surgical cases during the pandemic period. 2024. Federação Brasileira de Ginecologia e Obstetrícia.
