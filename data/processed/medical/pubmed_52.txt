PURPOSE This study investigated changes in interpersonal violence and utilization of trauma recovery services during the COVID19 pandemic. At an urban level I trauma center, trauma recovery services TRS provide education, counseling, peer support, and coordination of rehabilitation and recovery to address social and mental health needs. The COVID19 pandemic prompted considerable changes in hospital services and increases in interpersonal victimization. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted between September 6, 2018 and December 20, 2020 for 1,908 victimofcrime patients, including 574 victims of interpersonal violence. Outcomes included length of stay associated with initial TRS presentation, number of subsequent emergency department visits, number of outpatient appointments, and utilization of specific specialties within the year following the initial traumatic event. RESULTS Patients were primarily female 59.4, single 80.1, nonHispanic 86.7, and Black 59.2. The mean age was 33.0 years, and 247 patients 49.2 presented due to physical assault, 132 26.3 due to gunshot wounds, and 76 15.1 due to sexual assault. The perpetrators were primarily partners 27.9 or strangers 23.3. During the study period, 266 patients mean, 14.9 patients per month presented before the declaration of COVID19 as a national emergency on March 13, 2020, while 236 patients mean, 25.9 patients per month presented afterward, representing a 74.6 increase in victimofcrime patients treated. Interactions with TRS decreased during the COVID19 period, with an average of 3.0 interactions per patient before COVID19 versus 1.9 after emergency declaration P0.01. Similarly, reductions in length of stay were noted the preCOVID19 average was 3.6 days, compared to 2.1 days postCOVID19 P0.01. CONCLUSIONS While interpersonal violence increased, TRS interactions decreased during the COVID19 pandemic, reflecting interruption of services, COVID19 precautions, and postponementcancellation of elective visits. Future direction of hospital policy to enable resource and service delivery to this population, despite internal and external challenges, appears warranted. 2024 The Korean Society of Traumatology.
