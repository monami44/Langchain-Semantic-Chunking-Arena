As e-commerce is quickly developing on the planet, particularly in recent years, many areas of life are affected, particularly the improvement in how individuals regulate themselves non-financially and financially in different transactions. In electronic payment or e-commerce payment, the gateway is a major component of the structure to assure that such exchanges occur without disputes, while maintaining the common security over such systems. Most Internet payment gateways in e-commerce provide monetary information to customers using trusted third parties directly to a payment gateway. Nonetheless, it is recognized that the cloud Web server is not considered a protected entity. This article aims to develop an efficient and secure electronic payment protocol for e-commerce where consumers can immediately connect with the merchant properly. Interestingly, the proposed system does not require the customer to input his/her identity in the merchantâ€™s website even though the customer can hide his/her identity and make a temporary identity to perform the service.
