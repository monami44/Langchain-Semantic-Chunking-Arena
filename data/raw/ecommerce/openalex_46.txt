Electronic commerce or e-commerce includes the service and good exchange through electronic support like the Internet. It plays a crucial role in today's business and users' experience. Also, e-commerce platforms produce a vast amount of information. So, Recommender Systems (RSs) are a solution to overcome the information overload problem. They provide personalized recommendations to improve user satisfaction. The present article illustrates a comprehensive and Systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding the papers published in the field of e-commerce recommender systems. We reviewed the selected papers to identify the gaps and significant issues of the RSs' traditional methods, which guide the researchers to do future work. So, we provided the traditional techniques, challenges, and open issues concerning traditional methods of the field of review based on the selected papers. This review includes five categories of the RSs' algorithms, including Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), Demographic-Based Filtering (DBF), hybrid filtering, and Knowledge-Based Filtering (KBF). Also, the salient points of each selected paper are briefly reported. The publication time of the selected papers ranged from 2008 to 2019. Also, we provided a comparison table of important issues of the selected papers as well as the tables of advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we provided a comparative table of metrics and review issues for the selected papers. And finally, the conclusions can, to a great extent, provide valuable guidelines for future studies.
