This study builds on resource based view (RBV) theory by examining the effects of e-commerce on exporting performance. Specifically, a framework is developed and tested to determine the e-commerce resources/capabilities–marketing efficiencies–performance relationship. To explore the impact of e-commerce on exporting, a two-stage methodological approach was employed. Results from 15 depth interviews with exporters were used to gain insight into types of e-commerce resources and capabilities and their impact on export marketing efficiencies and performance. Next, the framework was empirically tested using a sample of 340 exporters. The evidence shows that specialized e-commerce marketing capabilities directly increase a firm's degree of distribution and communication efficiency, which in turn leads to enhanced export venture market performance. Overall, the analyses provide support for the need to incorporate e-commerce constructs into existing RBV theory in export marketing. Theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed and directions for future research are offered.
