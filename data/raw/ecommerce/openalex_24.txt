This study investigates the effect of media richness on consumer decision-making and channel choice, and grounds the investigation in media richness theory, task-media fit hypotheses and cognitive cost (behavioral decision theory). Findings from three experiments provide evidence that consumers prefer channels with medium (e.g., e-commerce) and high (e.g., in-store) media richness for carrying out complex decision-making tasks. Findings reveal that consumers are likely to undertake simple decision-making tasks on channels that incorporate low (e.g., m-commerce) levels of media richness. Findings also demonstrate that product type moderates the effect of media richness on perceived channel-task fit, post-purchase evaluation, and channel choice. These insights should prove helpful to managers in managing content across different channels.
