This paper discusses the challenges of applying named entity linking in a rich, complex domain â€“ specifically, the linking of (1) military units, (2) places and (3) people in the context of interlinked Second World War data. Multiple sub-scenarios are discussed in detail through concrete evaluations, analyzing the problems faced, and the solutions developed. A key contribution of this work is to highlight the heterogeneity of problems and approaches needed even inside a single domain, depending on both the source data as well as the target authority.
