Between 1942 and 1945, the Patkai mountains of Assam and Manipur became India’s front line against Japan. This article charts the concatenation of political, cultural, and socio-economic transformations that the Second World War caused in a region that colonial authorities had tried to cordon off. The conflict had push-and-pull effects on the Patkai, intensifying direct state penetration yet reviving long-standing transregional ties with Tibet, China, and Southeast Asia. When ‘national’ borders appeared with Burma and India’s independence two years later, the effect was jarring. As such, the war was a watershed in the postcolonial evolution of northeastern India and northwestern Burma.
