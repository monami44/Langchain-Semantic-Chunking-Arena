To this day process of identification of missing persons from skeletonized human remains with help of forensic genetics proves to be complex and challenging. The success rate of genetic identification in bones strongly depends on a combination of various factors, most importantly environmental factors and post-mortem interval. Furthermore, there are individual-specific factors that affect DNA preservation, such as race, gender, age and type of skeletal elements. The goal of our study was to optimize sampling process through determining which skeletal elements are superior in their preservation of DNA in 70-yearold skeletons belonging to victims of Second World War. We sampled different types of bones and teeth from three such skeletons found in Slovenian hidden mass grave Huda jama, 56 elements from each respective skeleton, together 168 elements. With the help of parameters, such as quantity of DNA, degradation rate and typing success, we tried to find the best types of elements to identify the victims. Prior to powdering bones and teeth, we removed contaminants. We decalcified 0.5 g bone and tooth powder followed by extraction and purification of DNA using Biorobot EZ1 (Qiagen). Quantification of obtained nuclear DNA was carried out using PowerQuant kit (Promega) and autosomal STR typing using ESSplex SE QS kit (Qiagen). Best parameters to assess skeletal elements that are superior in their DNA preservation were quantity of DNA and number of successfully typed STR loci. Metacarpal and metatarsal bones proved to be the best, followed by intermediate cuneiform, first distal foot phalanx, talus, petrous bone and tibia. We also created elimination database for persons involved in exhumation, anthropological and genetic analyses and exclude potential contamination.
