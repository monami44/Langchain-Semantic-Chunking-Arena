We present preferred classical business cycle turning points for New Zealand's post-Second World War economy, using the Bry-Broshan dating algorithm on a long term quarterly time series of real GDP. From these, we identify nine recessions and their associated recovery paths for a period approaching 70 years and provide evidence on their key characteristics. Two key specific findings are as follows: (1) on average, real GDP and employment cycles have been associated around 90 per cent of the time and (2) the strength of New Zealand's business cycle recoveries has been independent of the depth, duration, or severity of the preceding recession.
