We argue that insurance can act as an analogon for the social situatedness of
machine learning systems, hence allowing machine learning scholars to take
insights from the rich and interdisciplinary insurance literature. Tracing the
interaction of uncertainty, fairness and responsibility in insurance provides a
fresh perspective on fairness in machine learning. We link insurance fairness
conceptions to their machine learning relatives, and use this bridge to
problematize fairness as calibration. In this process, we bring to the
forefront two themes that have been largely overlooked in the machine learning
literature: responsibility and aggregate-individual tensions.
