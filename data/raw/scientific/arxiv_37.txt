metric-learn is an open source Python package implementing supervised and
weakly-supervised distance metric learning algorithms. As part of
scikit-learn-contrib, it provides a unified interface compatible with
scikit-learn which allows to easily perform cross-validation, model selection,
and pipelining with other machine learning estimators. metric-learn is
thoroughly tested and available on PyPi under the MIT licence.
