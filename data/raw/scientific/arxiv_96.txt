In this chapter, we present the main classic machine learning methods. A
large part of the chapter is devoted to supervised learning techniques for
classification and regression, including nearest-neighbor methods, linear and
logistic regressions, support vector machines and tree-based algorithms. We
also describe the problem of overfitting as well as strategies to overcome it.
We finally provide a brief overview of unsupervised learning methods, namely
for clustering and dimensionality reduction.
