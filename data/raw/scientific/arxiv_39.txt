We propose a clustering-based iterative algorithm to solve certain
optimization problems in machine learning, where we start the algorithm by
aggregating the original data, solving the problem on aggregated data, and then
in subsequent steps gradually disaggregate the aggregated data. We apply the
algorithm to common machine learning problems such as the least absolute
deviation regression problem, support vector machines, and semi-supervised
support vector machines. We derive model-specific data aggregation and
disaggregation procedures. We also show optimality, convergence, and the
optimality gap of the approximated solution in each iteration. A computational
study is provided.
