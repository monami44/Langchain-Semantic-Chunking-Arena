With the advance of the powerful heterogeneous, parallel and distributed
computing systems and ever increasing immense amount of data, machine learning
has become an indispensable part of cutting-edge technology, scientific
research and consumer products. In this study, we present a review of modern
machine and deep learning. We provide a high-level overview for the latest
advanced machine learning algorithms, applications, and frameworks. Our
discussion encompasses parallel distributed learning, deep learning as well as
federated learning. As a result, our work serves as an introductory text to the
vast field of modern machine learning.
