As machine learning has become increasingly popular over the last few
decades, so too has the number of machine learning interfaces for implementing
these models. Whilst many R libraries exist for machine learning, very few
offer extended support for survival analysis. This is problematic considering
its importance in fields like medicine, bioinformatics, economics, engineering,
and more. mlr3proba provides a comprehensive machine learning interface for
survival analysis and connects with mlr3's general model tuning and
benchmarking facilities to provide a systematic infrastructure for survival
modeling and evaluation.
