In this article, we extend the conventional framework of
convolutional-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine to learn highly abstract features
among abitrary number of time related input maps by constructing a layer of
multiplicative units, which capture the relations among inputs. In many cases,
more than two maps are strongly related, so it is wise to make multiplicative
unit learn relations among more input maps, in other words, to find the optimal
relational-order of each unit. In order to enable our machine to learn
relational order, we developed a reinforcement-learning method whose optimality
is proven to train the network.
