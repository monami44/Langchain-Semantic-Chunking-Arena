The main goal of statistical learning theory is to provide a fundamental
framework for the problem of decision making and model construction based on
sets of data. Here, we present a brief introduction to the fundamentals of
statistical learning theory, in particular the difference between empirical and
structural risk minimization, including one of its most prominent
implementations, i.e. the Support Vector Machine.
