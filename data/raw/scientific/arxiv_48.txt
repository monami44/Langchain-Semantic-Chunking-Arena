Despite incredible recent advances in machine learning, building machine
learning applications remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive for
all but the best-trained, best-funded engineering organizations. This expense
comes not from a need for new and improved statistical models but instead from
a lack of systems and tools for supporting end-to-end machine learning
application development, from data preparation and labeling to
productionization and monitoring. In this document, we outline opportunities
for infrastructure supporting usable, end-to-end machine learning applications
in the context of the nascent DAWN (Data Analytics for What's Next) project at
Stanford.
