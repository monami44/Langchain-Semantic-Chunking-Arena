This is a collection of (mostly) pen-and-paper exercises in machine learning.
The exercises are on the following topics: linear algebra, optimisation,
directed graphical models, undirected graphical models, expressive power of
graphical models, factor graphs and message passing, inference for hidden
Markov models, model-based learning (including ICA and unnormalised models),
sampling and Monte-Carlo integration, and variational inference.
