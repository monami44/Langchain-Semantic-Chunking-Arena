Machine learning techniques have influenced the field of computer
architecture like many other fields. This paper studies how the fundamental
machine learning techniques can be applied towards computer architecture
problems. We also provide a detailed survey of computer architecture research
that employs different machine learning methods. Finally, we present some
future opportunities and the outstanding challenges that need to be overcome to
exploit full potential of machine learning for computer architecture.
