TF.Learn is a high-level Python module for distributed machine learning
inside TensorFlow. It provides an easy-to-use Scikit-learn style interface to
simplify the process of creating, configuring, training, evaluating, and
experimenting a machine learning model. TF.Learn integrates a wide range of
state-of-art machine learning algorithms built on top of TensorFlow's low level
APIs for small to large-scale supervised and unsupervised problems. This module
focuses on bringing machine learning to non-specialists using a general-purpose
high-level language as well as researchers who want to implement, benchmark,
and compare their new methods in a structured environment. Emphasis is put on
ease of use, performance, documentation, and API consistency.
