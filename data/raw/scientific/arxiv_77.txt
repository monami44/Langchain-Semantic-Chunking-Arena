The prediction of epileptic seizure has always been extremely challenging in
medical domain. However, as the development of computer technology, the
application of machine learning introduced new ideas for seizure forecasting.
Applying machine learning model onto the predication of epileptic seizure could
help us obtain a better result and there have been plenty of scientists who
have been doing such works so that there are sufficient medical data provided
for researchers to do training of machine learning models.
