Over the past two decades machine learning has permeated almost every realm
of technology. At the same time, many researchers have begun using category
theory as a unifying language, facilitating communication between different
scientific disciplines. It is therefore unsurprising that there is a burgeoning
interest in applying category theory to machine learning. We aim to document
the motivations, goals and common themes across these applications. We touch on
gradient-based learning, probability, and equivariant learning.
