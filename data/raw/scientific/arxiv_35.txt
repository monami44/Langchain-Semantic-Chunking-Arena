This paper introduces a machine learning potential repository that includes
Pareto optimal machine learning potentials. It also shows the systematic
development of accurate and fast machine learning potentials for a wide range
of elemental systems. As a result, many Pareto optimal machine learning
potentials are available in the repository from a website. Therefore, the
repository will help many scientists to perform accurate and fast atomistic
simulations.
