Machine learning has more and more effect on our every day's life. This field
keeps growing and expanding into new areas. Machine learning is based on the
implementation of artificial intelligence that gives systems the capability to
automatically learn and enhance from experiments without being explicitly
programmed. Machine Learning algorithms apply mathematical equations to analyze
datasets and predict values based on the dataset. In the field of
cybersecurity, machine learning algorithms can be utilized to train and analyze
the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) on security-related datasets. In this
paper, we tested different machine learning algorithms to analyze NSL-KDD
dataset using KNIME analytics.
