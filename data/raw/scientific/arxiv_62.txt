Meta-learning, or learning to learn, is the science of systematically
observing how different machine learning approaches perform on a wide range of
learning tasks, and then learning from this experience, or meta-data, to learn
new tasks much faster than otherwise possible. Not only does this dramatically
speed up and improve the design of machine learning pipelines or neural
architectures, it also allows us to replace hand-engineered algorithms with
novel approaches learned in a data-driven way. In this chapter, we provide an
overview of the state of the art in this fascinating and continuously evolving
field.
