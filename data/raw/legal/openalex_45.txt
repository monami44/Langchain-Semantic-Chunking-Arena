The proposal for Regulation 2017/1939 establishing the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (The EPPO Regulation) was criticized for completely excluding the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) from judicial review of decisions on forum of prosecution by the EPPO, an EU body. The system of judicial review under the EPPO Regulation has improved significantly relative to its initial proposal, by enabling national courts to refer preliminary questions to the CJEU. Despite this, several issues remain. This article examines whether the limitations imposed by the EPPO Regulation on the use of the action for annulment procedure laid down in Article 263 TFEU comply with EU primary law. More specifically, whether it complies with effective judicial protection as protected under Article 47 CFR, and the legal basis for the EPPO’s system of judicial review, Article 86(3) TFEU. We argue that the preliminary reference procedure is not effective enough in remedying the limited access to the action for annulment procedure to reliably safeguard the defendants’ right to effective judicial protection. To the extent that the current system for judicial review under the EPPO Regulation is at odds with the Article 47 CFR, the EU legislator did not have the competence to enact it under Article 86(3) TFEU. This article proposes that in order to circumvent the unlawful restrictions imposed by the EPPO Regulation, defendants could and should make use of the action for annulment procedure to contest the EPPO’s choice of forum.
