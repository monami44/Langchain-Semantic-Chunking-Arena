In the light of the key findings of a recent EU project, this paper examines the complex phenomenon of human trafficking in Europe. The analysis investigates the extent to which human trafficking legislation assists legal and judicial authorities in recognising and protecting victims. Following a review of the various confounding issues around victims' identification, the paper promptly targets the concept of 'vulnerability' as a decisive tool for effective intervention in human trafficking. Finally, this paper offers interesting insights into the role of Directive 2011/36/EU and its system of enforcement towards enhanced protection for victims of human trafficking.
