BACKGROUND: Despite several studies on self-evaluation of health and body shape, 
existing research on the risk factors of self-perceived overweight is 
insufficient, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the risk factors affecting self-perceived 
overweight and examine how the prevalence of self-perceived overweight has 
changed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we analyzed the 
impact of altered lifestyles due to COVID-19 on this phenomenon.
METHODS: The data used in the study were obtained from middle and high school 
students who participated in the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey 
(N=1,189,586). This survey was a 2-stage stratified cluster sampling survey 
representative of South Korean adolescents. We grouped the survey results by 
year and estimated the slope in the prevalence of self-perceived overweight 
before and during the pandemic using weighted linear regression, as well as the 
prevalence tendencies of self-perceived overweight according to various risk 
factors. We used prevalence ratios to identify the risk factors for 
self-perceived overweight. In addition, we conducted comparisons of risk factors 
in different periods to identify their associations with the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: The prevalence of self-perceived overweight was much higher than 
BMI-based overweight among 1,189,586 middle and high school participants (grade 
7-12) from 2005 to 2022 (female participants: n=577,102, 48.51%). From 2005 to 
2019 (prepandemic), the prevalence of self-perceived overweight increased 
(β=2.80, 95% CI 2.70-2.90), but from 2020 to 2022 (pandemic) it decreased 
(β=-0.53, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.33). During the pandemic, individuals with higher 
levels of stress or lower household economic status exhibited a more substantial 
decrease in the rate of self-perceived overweight. The prevalence of 
self-perceived overweight tended to be higher among individuals with poor 
academic performance, lower economic status, poorer subjective health, and a 
higher stress level.
CONCLUSIONS: Our nationwide study, conducted over 18 years, indicated that 
self-perceived overweight decreased during the COVID-19 period while identifying 
low academic performance and economic status as risk factors. These findings 
suggest the need for policies and facilities to address serious dieting and body 
dissatisfaction resulting from self-perceived overweight by developing 
counseling programs for adolescents with risk factors such as lower school 
performance and economic status.
