OBJECTIVE: To assess COVID-19 vaccination prevalence and explore whether health 
beliefs were associated with vaccination among firefighters.
METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to Minnesota 
firefighters in March - April 2022. Survey questions included demographics, 
vaccination status, and beliefs about COVID-19 and vaccines.
RESULTS: Of the survey respondents (N = 974, 91% male, 89% White), 76% were 
fully vaccinated and 53% were boosted. Firefighters were less likely to be 
vaccinated if they reported more perceived barriers (OR = 0.42, p < .001), 
greater decision-making ease (OR = 0.42, p < .001), and greater autonomy (OR = 
0.65, p = .04). Greater perceived benefits (OR = 2.63, p < .001) and social 
norms (OR = 2.10, p < .001) were associated with a greater likelihood of being 
vaccinated. Similar results were seen predicting booster status.
CONCLUSIONS: Firefighters had similar vaccination rates as the general 
population, despite high exposure risks. Health beliefs are strongly related to 
vaccination status.
