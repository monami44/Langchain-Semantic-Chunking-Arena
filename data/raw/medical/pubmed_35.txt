PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe stroke survivors' experiences receiving 
telemedicine visits at the Lone Star Stroke Consortium during the COVID-19 
pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive phenomenological design was 
applied to gather patients' telemedicine experiences through in-depth 
interviews, using a study guide. Audio-recorded interviews were conducted via 
ZOOM and transcribed verbatim. Two independent reviewers used the Giorgi 
descriptive method to analyze the data and search for the essence of stroke 
survivors' follow-up telemedicine experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: Fifteen underserved patients were recruited: mean age, 51.8 (15.7), and 
9 (60%) females. Three themes emerged: (1) vivid memory of the stroke acute 
phase, (2) poststroke care experiences, and (3) perceived telemedicine 
experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: The phenomenon of follow-up telemedicine visits during COVID-19 
pandemic, as experienced by the stroke survivors, was positive. It showed 
patients' improved care access for poststroke visits. Telemedicine was 
satisfactory, except where the full medical exam was needed. Study findings 
highlight the individual approach was important, as well as the need for 
reliable internet and training to improve patients' technological skills. A 
hybrid approach for post-pandemic follow-up visits (in-person and telemedicine) 
was recommended by stroke survivors. These findings suggest that telemedicine is 
feasible and effective for poststroke care. Additional strategies are needed to 
improve future telemedicine integration into the continuum of care.
