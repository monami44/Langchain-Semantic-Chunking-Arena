INTRODUCTION: National health policies to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus 
in the US resulted in widespread school closures and disrupted learning in 
Spring 2020.
METHODS: This study draws on unique individual-level data from n = 282 5-12 year 
olds enrolled in the NIH Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes 
(ECHO) Research Program to investigate associations between caregiver-reported 
duration of Spring 2020 learning disruptions and academic achievement.
RESULTS: Linear regression analyses estimated that children who experienced more 
than 4 weeks of instruction disruptions in Spring 2020 scored 4.5 points [95% 
CI: -8.77, -0.22] lower on age-normed math assessments compared to peers who had 
four or fewer weeks of disruption, adjusting for sociodemographic variables, 
pre-pandemic vocabulary, and COVID-19 family hardships and stress. No 
differences were found for reading. Children whose caregivers had higher levels 
of pandemic-related traumatic stress and lower educational attainment also had 
lower math scores, adjusting for all other covariates.
DISCUSSION: Results suggest educators and schools focus additional attention on 
supporting math instruction for children who experienced extended learning 
disruptions.
