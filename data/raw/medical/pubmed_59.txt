INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: We investigated (1) work status changes during COVID-19, 
(2) financial resource adequacy, (3) preferences for work requirements (e.g. 
remote, workplace, mixed) and (4) work requirements versus preferences, among 
people with systemic sclerosis.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of participants in the Scleroderma 
Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Cohort, which enrolled 
participants from the ongoing Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network 
Cohort and externally in April 2020. In August 2022, participants completed 
questions on work status, financial well-being using the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau Financial Well-Being Scale, work requirements and work 
requirement preferences.
RESULTS: A total of 298 participants with systemic sclerosis were included. Mean 
age was 58.6 years (SD = 11.4). There were 101 (34%) participants working at the 
start of the pandemic and still working in August 2022, 179 (60%) not working at 
the start of the pandemic and still not working, 10 (3%) who stopped working 
after April 2020 and 8 (3%) who started working. Mean financial well-being did 
not change from April 2020 to August 2022 (difference: 0.2 points; 95% 
confidence interval: -1.1 to 0.7). Working participants (N = 109) preferred 
flexible work requirements (N = 34, 31%) or working entirely remotely (N = 32, 
29%), but most were required to work entirely at a workplace (N = 35, 32%) or 
combined workplace and remotely with a fixed schedule (N = 31, 28%).
CONCLUSION: Work status and financial well-being did not change substantively 
among people with systemic sclerosis during the pandemic. Flexible work policies 
may support people with systemic sclerosis to work.

BACKGROUND: Visual interpretation of PET and CMR may fail to identify cardiac 
sarcoidosis (CS) with high specificity. This study aimed to evaluate the role of 
[18F]FDG PET and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)-CMR radiomic features in 
differentiating CS from another cause of myocardial inflammation, in this case 
patients with cardiac-related clinical symptoms following COVID-19.
METHODS: [18F]FDG PET and LGE-CMR were treated separately in this work. There 
were 35 post-COVID-19 (PC) and 40 CS datasets. Regions of interest were 
delineated manually around the entire left ventricle for the PET and LGE-CMR 
datasets. Radiomic features were then extracted. The ability of individual 
features to correctly identify image data as CS or PC was tested to predict the 
clinical classification of CS vs. PC using Mann-Whitney U-tests and logistic 
regression. Features were retained if the P-value was <0.00053, the AUC was 
>0.5, and the accuracy was >0.7. After applying the correlation test, 
uncorrelated features were used as a signature (joint features) to train machine 
learning classifiers. For LGE-CMR analysis, to further improve the results, 
different classifiers were used for individual features besides logistic 
regression, and the results of individual features of each classifier were 
screened to create a signature that included all features that followed the 
previously mentioned criteria and used it them as input for machine learning 
classifiers.
RESULTS: The Mann-Whitney U-tests and logistic regression were trained on 
individual features to build a collection of features. For [18F]FDG PET 
analysis, the maximum target-to-background ratio (TBRmax ) showed a high area 
under the curve (AUC) and accuracy with small P-values (<0.00053), but the 
signature performed better (AUC 0.98 and accuracy 0.91). For LGE-CMR analysis, 
the Gray Level Dependence Matrix (gldm)-Dependence Non-Uniformity showed good 
results with small error bars (accuracy 0.75 and AUC 0.87). However, by applying 
a Support Vector Machine classifier to individual LGE-CMR features and creating 
a signature, a Random Forest classifier displayed better AUC and accuracy (0.91 
and 0.84, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Using radiomic features may prove useful in identifying individuals 
with CS. Some features showed promising results in differentiating between PC 
and CS. By automating the analysis, the patient management process can be 
accelerated and improved.
