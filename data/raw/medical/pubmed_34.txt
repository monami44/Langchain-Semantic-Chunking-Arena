INTRODUCTION: Prior to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) had the largest telehealth program in the 
United States. The pandemic motivated providers within the VA to expand 
telehealth in effort to reduce disrupted care while mitigating risks. The 
pandemic provides a rare opportunity to examine how to better engage veterans 
experiencing housing instability (HI) in telehealth diabetes care.
METHODS: Mixed methods design to examine VA video connect (VVC) diabetes care 
utilization among veterans experiencing HI from March 1, 2019, to March 1, 2022, 
combining multivariable regression analyses of VA administrative data with 
semi-structured interviews. Study aims included: (a) examine changes in diabetes 
care delivery mode over the peri-pandemic timeframe; (b) identify 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with VVC care among 
veterans with HI; and (c) understand the facilitators and barriers of VVC 
utilization.
RESULTS: Totally, 5904 veterans were eligible for study analysis. Veterans who 
are female (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.0; p < 0.0001), self-identify as Hispanic 
(OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.9; p = 0.02), are married (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.2, 1.6; 
p < 0.0001), and are in VA priority group 1 (OR: 1.21; 95% CI 1.1, 1.4; 
p = 0.004) were more likely to use VVC the pandemic. Veterans of older age (OR: 
0.97; 95% CI: 0.97, 0.98; p < .0001) and rural dwelling (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.7, 
1.2; p = 0.04), were less likely to use VVC. Thirteen VA providers and 15 
veterans were interviewed. Veterans reported that decisions about using VVC were 
driven by limitations in in-person care availability, safety, and convenience.
DISCUSSION: Telehealth played an important role in providing veterans with HI 
access to diabetes care during the pandemic. Future interventions should seek to 
increase education and technology in effort to increase VVC uptake into routine 
diabetes care to ensure veterans' optimal and equitable access.
