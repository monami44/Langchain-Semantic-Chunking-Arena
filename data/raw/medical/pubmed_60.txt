BACKGROUND: We conducted the first non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial 
to determine whether lifestyle therapy is non-inferior to psychotherapy with 
respect to mental health outcomes and costs when delivered via online 
videoconferencing.
METHODS: An individually randomised, group treatment design with 
computer-generated block randomisation was used. Between May 2021-April 2022, 
182 adults with a Distress Questionnaire-5 score = ≥8 (indicative depression) 
were recruited from a tertiary mental health service in regional Victoria, 
Australia and surrounds. Participants were assigned to six 90-min sessions over 
8-weeks using group-based, online videoconferencing comprising: (1) lifestyle 
therapy (targeting nutrition, physical activity) with a dietitian and exercise 
physiologist (n = 91) or (2) psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) with 
psychologists (n = 91). The primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9) depression at 8-weeks (non-inferiority margin ≤2) using Generalised 
Estimating Equations (GEE). Cost-minimisation analysis estimated the mean 
difference in total costs from health sector and societal perspectives. Outcomes 
were assessed by blinded research assistants using Computer Assisted Telephone 
Interviews. Results are presented per-protocol (PP) and Intention to Treat (ITT) 
using beta coefficients with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs).
FINDINGS: The sample was 80% women (mean: 45-years [SD:13.4], mean PHQ-9:10.5 
[SD:5.7]. An average 4.2 of 6 sessions were completed, with complete data for 
n = 132. Over 8-weeks, depression reduced in both arms (PP: Lifestyle (n = 70) 
mean difference:-3.97, 95% CIs:-5.10, -2.84; and Psychotherapy (n = 62): mean 
difference:-3.74, 95% CIs:-5.12, -2.37; ITT: Lifestyle (n = 91) mean 
difference:-4.42, 95% CIs: -4.59, -4.25; Psychotherapy (n = 91) mean 
difference:-3.82, 95% CIs:-4.05, -3.69) with evidence of non-inferiority (PP GEE 
β:-0.59; 95% CIs:-1.87, 0.70, n = 132; ITT GEE β:-0.49, 95% CIs:-1.73, 0.75, 
n = 182). Three serious adverse events were recorded. While lifestyle therapy 
was delivered at lower cost, there were no differences in total costs (health 
sector adjusted mean difference: PP AUD$156 [95% CIs -$182, $611, ITT AUD$190 
[95% CIs -$155, $651] ]; societal adjusted mean difference: PP AUD$350 [95% 
CIs:-$222, $1152] ITT AUD$ 408 [95% CIs -$139, $1157].
INTERPRETATION: Remote-delivered lifestyle therapy was non-inferior to 
psychotherapy with respect to clinical and cost outcomes. If replicated in a 
fully powered RCT, this approach could increase access to allied health 
professionals who, with adequate training and guidelines, can deliver mental 
healthcare at comparable cost to psychologists.
FUNDING: This trial was funded by the Australian Medical Research Future Fund 
(GA133346) under its Covid-19 Mental Health Research Grant Scheme.
