OBJECTIVES: Depression and anxiety are emotional difficulties that are common 
among adolescents. Adolescents suffering from depression and anxiety can exhibit 
problems such as antisocial behavior, aggression, and academic slump. This study 
aimed to explore the factors influencing adolescents' depression and anxiety 
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
METHODS: This study examined the data from an online student health survey 
conducted by the Ministry of Education in 2022. The survey participants were 
131194 students ranging from the first grade of middle school to the third grade 
of high school. The influence of each variable on depression and anxiety was 
examined.
RESULTS: Factors that predicted depression and anxiety were sex (female), grade 
level (higher), financial difficulties (existing or unknown), physical activity 
(higher), sleep time (shorter), media usage time (higher), family/friends 
relationship (worse), and change in the health status of family, friends, and 
oneself due to COVID-19 (worse).
CONCLUSION: These results may help identify patterns of depression and anxiety 
among adolescents caused by COVID-19 and maximize the intervention effect.
