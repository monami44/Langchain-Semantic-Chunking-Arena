OBJECTIVE: To address the complexities of distinguishing truth from falsehood in 
the context of the COVID-19 infodemic, this paper focuses on utilizing deep 
learning models for infodemic ternary classification detection.
METHODS: Eight commonly used deep learning models are employed to categorize 
collected records as true, false, or uncertain. These models include fastText, 
three models based on recurrent neural networks, two models based on 
convolutional neural networks, and two transformer-based models.
RESULTS: Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for each category, along with 
overall accuracy, are presented to establish benchmark results. Additionally, a 
comprehensive analysis of the confusion matrix is conducted to provide insights 
into the models' performance.
CONCLUSION: Given the limited availability of infodemic records and the 
relatively modest size of the two tested data sets, models with pretrained 
embeddings or simpler architectures tend to outperform their more complex 
counterparts. This highlights the potential efficiency of pretrained or simpler 
models for ternary classification in COVID-19 infodemic detection and 
underscores the need for further research in this area.
