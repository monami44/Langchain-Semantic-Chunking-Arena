BACKGROUND: Understanding the facilitators, barriers and hesitancy to accepting 
COVID-19 booster doses is important for encouraging recommended vaccination. 
This evidence brief summarizes literature on the intention to accept or reject 
COVID-19 vaccine booster doses and the factors associated with intention/uptake 
among individuals in Canada.
METHODS: A database of COVID-19 literature established at the Public Health 
Agency of Canada was searched for articles referencing vaccination and 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards COVID-19 boosters. A grey literature 
search of Canadian governmental and academic institutions was also conducted. 
Primary research conducted in Canada (n=21) and relevant systematic reviews of 
the global literature (n=8) were included in this evidence brief.
RESULTS: Intentions to get a booster dose in the general population have 
decreased between 2021-2023, with intentions varying across subpopulations. In 
Canada and within the global systematic reviews, facilitators, barriers and 
hesitancy were similar. Older age was the most common factor positively 
associated with intention/uptake of a booster, and the most common motivators 
were government/healthcare provider recommendations and helping to protect 
others. The main reasons for hesitancy were concerns about vaccine side effects 
and a lack of belief in the vaccine's efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Intentions to get a booster dose have decreased in Canada. 
Understanding the reasons for vaccine hesitancy and motivators for obtaining a 
booster can help guide future public health COVID-19 booster vaccination 
programs.
