Background & objectives Genetic analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains circulating in India during 2020-2022 was 
carried out to understand the evolution of potentially expanding and divergent 
clades. Methods SARS-CoV-2 sequences (n=612) randomly selected from among the 
sequences of samples collected through a nationwide network of Virus Research 
Diagnostic Laboratories during 2020 (n=1532) and Indian sequences available in 
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data during March 2020-March 2022 
(n=53077), were analyzed using the phylo-geo haplotype network approach with 
reference to the Wuhan prototype sequence. Results On haplotype analysis, 420 
haplotypes were revealed from 643 segregating sites among the sequences. 
Haplotype sharing was noted among the strains from different geographical 
regions. Nevertheless, the genetic distance among the viral haplotypes from 
different clades could differentiate the strains into distinct haplo groups 
regarding variant emergence. Interpretation & conclusions The haplotype analysis 
revealed that the G and GR clades were co-evolved and an epicentrefor the 
evolution of the GH, GK and GRA clades. GH was more frequently identified in 
northern parts of India than in other parts, whereas GK was detected less in 
north India than in other parts. Thus, the network analysis facilitated a 
detailed illustration of the pathways of evolution and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 
variants.
