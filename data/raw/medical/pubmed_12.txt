SARS-CoV-2 virus infects cells by engaging with ACE2 requiring protease TMPRSS2. 
ACE2 is highly expressed in kidneys. Predictors for severe disease are high age 
and male sex. We hypothesized that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins are more abundant 
(1) in males and with increasing age in kidney and (2) in urine and 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) from male patients with COVID-19 and (3) SARS-CoV-2 
is present in urine and EVs during infection. Kidney cortex samples from 
patients subjected to cancer nephrectomy (male/female; < 50 years/˃75 years, 
n = 24; ˃80 years, n = 15) were analyzed for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels. 
Urine from patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection was analyzed for ACE2 
and TMPRSS2. uEVs were used for immunoblotting and SARS-CoV-2 mRNA and antigen 
detection. Tissue ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels did not change with age. ACE2 
was not more abundant in male kidneys in any age group. ACE2 protein was 
associated with proximal tubule apical membranes in cortex. TMPRSS2 was observed 
predominantly in the medulla. ACE2 was elevated significantly in uEVs and urine 
from patients with COVID-19 with no sex difference compared with urine from 
controls w/wo albuminuria. TMPRSS2 was elevated in uEVs from males compared to 
female. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 did not co-localize in uEVs/apical membranes. 
SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and mRNA were not detected in urine. Higher kidney ACE2 
protein abundance is unlikely to explain higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 
infection in males. Kidney tubular cells appear not highly susceptible to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Loss of ACE2 into urine in COVID could impact 
susceptibility and angiotensin metabolism.
