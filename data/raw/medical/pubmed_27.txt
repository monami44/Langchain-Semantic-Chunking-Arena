Treatment modifications adopted during pandemic aimed at reducing infection, 
myelosuppression, and optimizing hospital resources. This study evaluated 
outcomes for pediatric patients with ALL who had treatment modifications during 
pandemic compared to historical cohorts at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo 
University, Egypt. Bi-directional cohort study included 378 patients. Treatment 
modifications included omission of specific drugs or adjusting chemotherapy 
schedules to 6-mercaptopurine/methotrexate. Median follow-up were 45.1 and 
43.2 months, for cohorts (A) and (B), respectively. The three-year overall 
survival were 84.9% and 87.5% (p = .48) and three-year relapse free survival 
were 82.8% and 86.5% (p = .11) for cohorts (A) and (B), respectively. 
Infection-related mortality was 11% and 4.4% for cohorts (A) and (B), 
respectively (p = .03). Treatment modifications adopted during the pandemic did 
not adversely affect the outcome of patients with ALL and notably reduced 
infection-related deaths. Longer follow-up is warranted to validate these 
findings.
