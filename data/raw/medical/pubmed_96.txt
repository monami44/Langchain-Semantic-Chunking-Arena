BACKGROUND: Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), is 
a poorly understood condition with symptoms across a range of biological domains 
that often have debilitating consequences. Some have recently suggested that 
lingering SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in the gut may impede serotonin production 
and that low serotonin may drive many Long COVID symptoms across a range of 
biological systems. Therefore, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
which increase synaptic serotonin availability, may be used to prevent or treat 
Long COVID. SSRIs are commonly prescribed for depression, therefore restricting 
a study sample to only include patients with depression can reduce the concern 
of confounding by indication.
METHODS: In an observational sample of electronic health records from patients 
in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) with a COVID-19 diagnosis 
between September 1, 2021, and December 1, 2022, and a comorbid depressive 
disorder, the leading indication for SSRI use, we evaluated the relationship 
between SSRI use during acute COVID-19 and subsequent 12-month risk of Long 
COVID (defined by ICD-10 code U09.9). We defined SSRI use as a prescription for 
SSRI medication beginning at least 30 days before acute COVID-19 and not ending 
before SARS-CoV-2 infection. To minimize bias, we estimated relationships using 
nonparametric targeted maximum likelihood estimation to aggressively adjust for 
high-dimensional covariates.
RESULTS: We analyzed a sample (n = 302,626) of patients with a diagnosis of a 
depressive condition before COVID-19 diagnosis, where 100,803 (33%) were using 
an SSRI. We found that SSRI users had a significantly lower risk of Long COVID 
compared to nonusers (adjusted causal relative risk 0.92, 95% CI (0.86, 0.99)) 
and we found a similar relationship comparing new SSRI users (first SSRI 
prescription 1 to 4 months before acute COVID-19 with no prior history of SSRI 
use) to nonusers (adjusted causal relative risk 0.89, 95% CI (0.80, 0.98)).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SSRI use during acute COVID-19 may be 
protective against Long COVID, supporting the hypothesis that serotonin may be a 
key mechanistic biomarker of Long COVID.
