Enduring heroism defined as persistent efforts to confront inequality and 
injustice is the focus of this article. Six exemplars are considered: Harriet 
Tubman, Crazy Horse, Jane Addams, Mohandas Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X. 
Similarities and differences in their pursuits are considered and linked to the 
larger literature on heroism. They are also contrasted with enduring anti-heroes 
to elevate roles of virtue and benevolence in long-term efforts to correct 
societal ills. What motivates enduring heroism is a central question. A 
hypothesis put forth is that distinct dimensions of eudaimonic well-being - 
especially, purpose in life, autonomy, environmental mastery, and personal 
growth - may be key elements that fuel efforts of enduring heroes. A final 
section underscores the need for such individuals in our era, drawing on 
wide-ranging evidence that inequality and injustice are worsening and have been 
exacerbated by major historical events (Great Recession, COVID-19 pandemic). Now 
more than ever enduring heroes are needed to help redress the enormous suffering 
around us.
