COVID-19 presents with a plethora of neurological signs and symptoms despite 
being characterized as a respiratory disease, including seizures, anxiety, 
depression, amnesia, attention deficits, and alterations in consciousness. The 
olfactory nerve is widely accepted as the neuroinvasive route by which the 
etiological agent SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain, but the trigeminal nerve is an 
often-overlooked additional route. Based on this consensus, we initially 
conducted a pilot experiment investigating the olfactory nerve route of 
SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion via intranasal inoculation in AC70 human ACE2 
transgenic mice. Notably, we found that the trigeminal ganglion is an early and 
highly efficient site of viral replication, which then rapidly spread widely 
throughout the brain where neurons were primarily targeted. Despite the 
extensive viral infection across the brain, obvious evidence of tissue pathology 
including inflammatory infiltration, glial activation, and apoptotic cell deaths 
were not consistently observed, albeit inflammatory cytokines were significantly 
induced. However, the expression levels of different genes related to neuronal 
function, including the neurotransmitter dopamine pathway as well as synaptic 
function, and markers of neuronal damage were altered as compared to 
mock-infected mice. Our findings suggest that the trigeminal nerve may serve as 
a neuroinvasive route complementary to the olfactory nerve and that the ensuing 
neuroinvasion presented a unique neuropathological profile. This study provides 
insights into potential neuropathogenic mechanisms utilized by coronaviruses.
