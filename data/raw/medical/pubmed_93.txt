Many subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged since its early stages, with mutations 
showing regional and racial differences. These mutations significantly affected 
the infectivity and severity of the virus. This study aimed to predict the 
mutations that occur during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and identify the key 
characteristics for making these predictions. We collected and organized data on 
the lineage, date, clade, and mutations of SARS-CoV-2 from publicly available 
databases and processed them to predict the mutations. In addition, we utilized 
various artificial intelligence models to predict newly emerging mutations and 
created various training sets based on clade information. Using only mutation 
information resulted in low performance of the learning models, whereas 
incorporating clade differentiation resulted in high performance in machine 
learning models, including XGBoost (accuracy: 0.999). However, mutations fixed 
in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of Omicron resulted in decreased 
predictive performance. Using these models, we predicted potential mutation 
positions for 24C, following the recently emerged 24A and 24B clades. We 
identified a mutation at position Q493 in the RBM region. Our study developed 
effective artificial intelligence models and characteristics for predicting new 
mutations in continuously evolving infectious viruses.
