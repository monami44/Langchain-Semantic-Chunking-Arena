BACKGROUND: We are entering a new era of antibody discovery and optimization 
where machine learning (ML) processes will become indispensable for the design 
and development of therapeutics.
METHODS: We have constructed a Humanoid Antibody Library for the discovery of 
therapeutics that is an initial step towards leveraging the utility of 
artificial intelligence and ML. We describe how we began our validation of the 
library for antibody discovery by isolating antibodies against a target of 
pandemic concern, SARS-CoV-2. The two main antibody quality aspects that we 
focused on were functional and biophysical characterization.
RESULTS: The applicability of our platform for effective therapeutic antibody 
discovery is demonstrated here with the identification of a panel of human 
monoclonal antibodies that are novel, diverse, and pharmacologically active.
CONCLUSIONS: These first-generation antibodies, without the need for affinity 
maturation, exhibited neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity across 
multiple strains and indicated high developability potential.
