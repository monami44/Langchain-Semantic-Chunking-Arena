Background & objectives We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19-related 
disruptions on ongoing and future projects related to neuroscience research and 
young researchers in India. Methods We conducted a countrywide online survey 
using a structured, self-administered questionnaire involving medical trainees, 
post-doctoral fellows, PhD students, early career faculty members and basic 
neuroscience researchers. The purpose was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on the respondents' ongoing/planned research activities and capture 
their concerns related to future research. Results Five hundred and four valid 
responses were analyzed. More than three-fourths of the respondents were in 
their early careers - 64.1 per cent were resident doctors, and 19.8 per cent 
were early career consultants. Maximum responses were received from respondents 
working in neurology (228; 45.2%), followed by psychiatry (192; 38.1%) and 
neurosurgery (49; 9.7%). More than three-fourths [83.5%, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 0.8-0.867] of the respondents reported that the pandemic had affected 
their research. About one-third of the respondents (171; 33.9%) reported delays 
in completing research studies. Respondents adapted to the pandemic's 
circumstances by making methodological changes in their research (155; 30.8%). 
Most respondents (301; 59.6%) reported being diverted from their traditional 
work settings to COVID-19-related clinical services. Respondents conducting 
prospective studies and randomized controlled trials and those diverted to 
COVID-related services were significantly more likely to report the adverse 
research impact. Interpretation & conclusions In our survey, an overwhelming 
majority of the respondents reported that the pandemic adversely impacted their 
study. This trend was independent of sex, designation, and research output of 
individual subjects. The serious impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
neurosciences research warrants the attention and concerted efforts of the 
research supervisors, institutional heads, funding agencies and other 
stakeholders.
