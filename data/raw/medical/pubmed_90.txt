INTRODUCTION: Burkina Faso implemented stringent measures in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic that profoundly affected its economy and might have 
exacerbated food insecurity. While prior studies have assessed the impact of 
these measures on consumers, there is a dearth of evidence of its effects on 
food producers in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study aims (i) to evaluate the 
repercussions of COVID-19 on the possession of food production assets and on the 
number of livestock owned; and (ii) to determine the correlation between the 
food insecurity experience scale (FIES) score, ownership of these assets, and 
the number of livestock owned.
METHODS: This study employs a pre-post comparison design in two panels of 
randomly selected households in Burkina Faso. While Panel A was constituted of 
384 households predominantly (76%) living in rural areas, Panel B comprised 504 
households, only half of which (51%) lived in rural areas. All households were 
visited twice: in July 2019 and February 2021, for Panel A, and in February 2020 
and February 2021, for Panel B. Panel B was added to the study before the 
pandemic thanks to additional funding; the timing of the survey was harmonized 
in both panels for the second round. Regression models were used with fixed 
effects at the household level, controlling for potential time-invariant 
confounding variables, and correlation coefficients between possession of 
production assets or number of livestock and FIES score were measured.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that the possession of some assets in Panel A 
(cart, livestock, bicycle, watch) was significantly reduced during the pandemic, 
as was the herd sizes among livestock-owning households in both panels. 
Households with fewer production assets and number of livestock were more likely 
to experience food insecurity.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the vulnerability of rural households in 
Burkina Faso to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Addressing the challenges faced by farming and livestock-owning households is 
crucial for mitigating food insecurity and improving resilience in the face of 
ongoing crises.
