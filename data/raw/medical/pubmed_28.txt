This study sought to understand reported impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
maternal and child health and nutrition behaviours during the first 1000 days of 
life. This qualitative and participatory substudy was embedded within mixed 
methods formative research conducted during 2020-2022 across two urban, three 
rural and one estate sector site in Sri Lanka. Semi-structured interviews among 
caregivers of children aged 6-23 months (n = 34), influencers of caregivers, 
such as health workers (n = 37), leaders (n = 10) and pregnant women (n = 20) 
were conducted. Participatory workshops (n = 14) triangulated interview 
findings. Interview data were analyzed to identify salient themes using Dedoose. 
Numerical data from voting conducted in workshops were summed and triangulated 
with interview data. Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and imposed 
restrictions shaped maternal and child health and nutrition behaviours through a 
complex interplay of factors. Imposed restrictions and changes to the food 
system contributed to temporary unemployment for wage workers and reduced 
purchasing power to maintain food security for vulnerable households. While 
deciding whether to seek care, fears of infection prevented usual care-seeking 
decisions. Also, reduced incomes and disrupted public transportation made 
transport to health care facilities for antenatal care services difficult. Once 
women reached facilities, medical services and quality of care were negatively 
impacted. Implementing expanded community-based services during home visits 
focused on the first 1000 days and beyond was one effective strategy to maintain 
maternal and child health and nutrition during the early pandemic in Sri Lanka.
