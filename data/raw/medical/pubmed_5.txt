BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the roles of cytokines and other 
laboratory parameters in determining the need for intensive care in COVID-19 
patients.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study. Demographic, clinical, and 
laboratory parameters of the patients were evaluated. Thirteen cytokines were 
measured along with baseline laboratory tests at admission and at 48-hour 
intervals: IL-1β, IFN-α, IFN-β, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-6, IL -8, IL-10, IL-2p70, 
IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-33.
RESULTS: COVID-19 was confirmed by PCR in 116 hospitalized patients. The mean 
age was 55.3 ± 16.4 years. Seventy-four (63.8%) of the patients were male and 42 
(36.2%) were female. Twenty-two (18.9%) patients (16 male, 6 female) were 
transferred to the intensive care unit. A significant increase in white blood 
cell (WBC), neutrophil (Neu) and lymphocyte (Lym) counts, Neu/Lym ratio (NLR), 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), INR (international normalized ratio), activated 
prothrombin time (aPTT), D-dimer (D-D), troponin (Trop), Pro-BNP (BNP), 
procalcitonin (PCT), ferritin (Fer), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values 
were observed in those requiring intensive care. A significant decrease was 
found in albumin (Alb) levels and Lym counts. Alb levels appeared to be 
protective against admission to intensive care. Except for IFN- α, IL-23, and 
IL-33, the baseline values of other cytokines were above the threshold values. 
MCP-1 and IL-6 were higher in patients requiring intensive care.
CONCLUSIONS: High NLR and LDH and low Alb levels, especially with an increase in 
MCP-1 and IL-6, were found to be the best predictors of a serious COVID-19 
infection.
