PURPOSE: This study investigated changes in interpersonal violence and 
utilization of trauma recovery services during the COVID-19 pandemic. At an 
urban level I trauma center, trauma recovery services (TRS) provide education, 
counseling, peer support, and coordination of rehabilitation and recovery to 
address social and mental health needs. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted 
considerable changes in hospital services and increases in interpersonal 
victimization.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted between September 6, 2018 and 
December 20, 2020 for 1,908 victim-of-crime patients, including 574 victims of 
interpersonal violence. Outcomes included length of stay associated with initial 
TRS presentation, number of subsequent emergency department visits, number of 
outpatient appointments, and utilization of specific specialties within the year 
following the initial traumatic event.
RESULTS: Patients were primarily female (59.4%), single (80.1%), non-Hispanic 
(86.7%), and Black (59.2%). The mean age was 33.0 years, and 247 patients 
(49.2%) presented due to physical assault, 132 (26.3%) due to gunshot wounds, 
and 76 (15.1%) due to sexual assault. The perpetrators were primarily partners 
(27.9%) or strangers (23.3%). During the study period, 266 patients (mean, 14.9 
patients per month) presented before the declaration of COVID-19 as a national 
emergency on March 13, 2020, while 236 patients (mean, 25.9 patients per month) 
presented afterward, representing a 74.6% increase in victim-of-crime patients 
treated. Interactions with TRS decreased during the COVID-19 period, with an 
average of 3.0 interactions per patient before COVID-19 versus 1.9 after 
emergency declaration (P<0.01). Similarly, reductions in length of stay were 
noted; the pre-COVID-19 average was 3.6 days, compared to 2.1 days post-COVID-19 
(P=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: While interpersonal violence increased, TRS interactions decreased 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting interruption of services, COVID-19 
precautions, and postponement/cancellation of elective visits. Future direction 
of hospital policy to enable resource and service delivery to this population, 
despite internal and external challenges, appears warranted.
