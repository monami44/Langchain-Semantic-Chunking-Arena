INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic became a 
worldwide public health crisis. It leads to raised levels of burnout and anxiety 
among the people of the medical and dental fraternity, especially those involved 
in various duties related to COVID-19. The present research focused on 
evaluating the prevalence and predictors of burnout among medical officers and 
dental surgeons in Haryana's state dental health services.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess burnout 
among medical officers and dental surgeons involved in COVID-19-related duties 
in state health services. Maslach's burnout scale was used to evaluate burnout. 
It is a prevalidated and self-administered questionnaire with three domains, 
that is, emotional exhaustion (EE), personal accomplishment (PA) assessment, and 
depersonalization (DP). The Chi square test, Student's t test (unpaired), and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc analysis were done wherever 
applicable. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to check the relationship 
among EE, DP, and PA.
RESULTS: A total of 200 study participants responded to the online survey. 
Nearly half of them (51%) were aged 25-34 years. The majority had service 
experience of up to 20 years (90%). Almost three-fourths (72%) of study 
participants performed duties for >8 h a day. Up to 86% reported that the second 
wave of COVID-19 caused increased burnout. Moderate-to-high degrees of 
occupational exhaustion (OE) and DP were reported among approximately 42% of 
study participants. Medical officers were reported to have statistically 
significantly higher levels of burnout compared to dental surgeons (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Moderate levels of burnout were reported among half of the study 
participants, suggestive of the need to address the issues related to mental 
health of healthcare providers.
