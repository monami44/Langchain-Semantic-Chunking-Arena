BACKGROUND: Identification of the opportunistic fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii in 
respiratory specimens presents challenges, particularly in differentiating 
between colonization and active infection. The present study assessed a 
probe-based real time PCR (qPCR) diagnostic effectiveness in patients with 
diverse underlying conditions, particularly those with COVID-19 and pulmonary 
insufficiency.
METHODS: To set up the qPCR, clinical samples from 281 patients with respiratory 
ailments were tested. Subsequently, a descriptive study was conducted on 112 
patients with pulmonary insufficiency with and without COVID-19 suspected of P. 
jirovecii infection. All specimens were subjected to DNA extraction followed by 
nested PCR and qPCR targeting the mitochondrial large subunit (mtLSU)-rRNA gene.
RESULTS: Based on nested PCR and qPCR, P. jirovecii was identified in 40 out of 
281 patients, with slight variations in positive samples observed across 
dilutions. Three patients who tested positive in nested PCR yielded negative 
results in probe-based qPCR. Conversely, three patients who tested positive in 
probe-based qPCR yielded negative results in nested PCR. Considering nested PCR 
as the golden standard, probe-based qPCR demonstrated good diagnostic 
performance, with 92.5% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity. Based on cycle 
threshold (Ct) values, the positive cases were categorized: ≤32 as infection, 
>35 as colonization, and a grey zone between these values (32 < X ≤ 35). The 
analysis of 112 PCP-suspected patients revealed a prevalence ranging from 6.25% 
(nested PCR) to 7% (probe-based qPCR).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested Ct values to differentiate Pneumocystis 
pneumonia/colonization in immunocompromised patients. To further augment the 
diagnostic sensitivity, it is recommended to integrate qPCR results with 
clinical parameters and biomarkers to offer a more precise understanding of 
Pneumocystis-related conditions.
