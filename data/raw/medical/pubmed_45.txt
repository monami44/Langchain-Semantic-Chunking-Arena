OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the thyroid hormone profile and its 
association with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients infected 
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted to a 
tertiary hospital due to SARS-CoV-2 infection between February 18 and May 18, 
2022. Clinical data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical 
record system. Based on the thyroid function, patients were divided into five 
groups: normal, non-thyroid illness syndrome (NTIS), hypothyroidism, 
thyrotoxicosis, and unclassified. The association between thyroid function and 
severe COVID-19 was detected using multivariable logistic regression and 
restricted cubic splines analysis.
RESULTS: This study included 3,161 patients, with 7.7% of them developing severe 
COVID-19. 44.9% of the patients had normal thyroid function, 36.5% had NTIS, 
6.7% had hypothyroidism, and 1.0% had thyrotoxicosis on admission. After 
adjusting for age, sex, and relevant clinical characteristics, NTIS and 
hypothyroidism were associated with increased risks of severe COVID-19 (odds 
ratio [OR] 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-3.56 and OR 2.29, 95% CI 
1.23-4.26, respectively), compared to normal thyroid function group. Among 
patients with NTIS or hypothyroidism, higher levels of total triiodothyronine 
(TT3) are associated with lower risks of severe COVID-19 (OR 0.73, 95% CI 
0.64-0.82, for every 0.1nmol/L increase in TT3 level).
CONCLUSION: Thyroid hormone profiles of NTIS or hypothyroidism are associated 
with increased risks of severe COVID-19. The decreased level of TT3 correlated 
with the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with NTIS or 
hypothyroidism.
