INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused 
unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems globally. The lack of quality 
guidelines on the management of COVID-19 in rheumatologic disease, renal 
disease, hematological malignancy, and solid organ transplant recipients has 
resulted in a wide variation in clinical practice.
METHODS: Using a Delphi process, a panel of 16 key opinion leaders developed 
clinical practice statements regarding vaccine recommendations in areas where 
standards are absent or limited. Agreement among practicing physicians with 
consensus statements was also assessed via an online physician survey. The 
strength of the consensus was determined by the following rating system: a 
strong rating was defined as all four key opinion leaders (KOLs) rating the 
statement ≥ 8, a moderate rating was defined as three out of four KOLs rating 
the statement ≥ 8, and no consensus was defined as less than three out of four 
KOLs provided a rating of ≤ 8. Specialists voted on agreement with each 
consensus statement for their disease area using the same ten-point scoring 
system.
RESULTS: Key opinion leaders in rheumatology, nephrology, and hematology 
achieved consensuses for all nine statements pertaining to the primary and 
booster series with transplant physicians reaching consensus on eight of nine 
statements. Experts agreed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and well 
tolerated by patients with rheumatological conditions, renal disease, 
hematologic malignancy, and recipients of solid organ transplants. The Delphi 
process yielded strong to moderate suggestions for the use of COVID-19 messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines and the necessity of the COVID-19 booster for 
the immunocompromised population. The expert panel had mixed feelings concerning 
the measurement of antibody titers, higher-dose mRNA vaccines, and the 
development of disease-specific COVID-19 guidance.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed the necessity of COVID-19 vaccines and 
boosters in immunocompromised patients with rheumatologic disease, renal 
disease, hematological malignancy, and solid organ transplant recipients. 
Statements where consensus was not achieved were due to absent or limited 
evidence.
