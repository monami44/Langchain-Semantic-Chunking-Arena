BACKGROUND: Neurological complications have been observed in approximately 30% 
of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether 
early assessment of the Neurological Pupil Index (NPiTM) derived from an 
automated pupillometry could predict mortality in critically ill COVID-19 
patients.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of adult critically ill COVID-19 patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit of a University Hospital; patients without 
NPi measurement were excluded. The worst NPi (i.e. lowest value from one eye) 
was collected daily and then computed over the first five days of assessment. 
Mortality was assessed at hospital discharge. The secondary endpoint involved 
assessing differences in neurological assessments between patients who developed 
neurological complications and those who did not.
RESULTS: A total of 217 patients were included over the study period (median age 
61 [50-68] years), 70% were males. A total of 97 patients (45%) died during the 
hospital stay. Among all patients, 35 (16%) experienced neurological 
complications. Non-survivors showed significantly a lower overall NPi (3.0 
[2.0-4.1] vs. 3.4 [2.7-4.2]; P=0.04) than survivors. At multivariate logistic 
regression NPi was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. 
Moreover, no differences in different NPi measurements were observed between 
patients with and without neurological complications.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, NPi values were not independent predictor of 
mortality and neurological complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
