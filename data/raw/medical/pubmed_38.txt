PURPOSE: Coaching is a well-described means of providing real-time, actionable 
feedback to learners. We aimed to determine whether dual coaching from faculty 
physicians and real inpatients led to an improvement in history-taking skills of 
clerkship medical students.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expert faculty physicians (on Zoom) directly observed 13 
clerkship medical students as they obtained a history from 26 real, hospitalized 
inpatients (in person), after which students received immediate feedback from 
both the physician and the patient. De-identified audio-video recordings of all 
interviews were scored by independent judges using a previously validated 
clinical rating tool to assess for improvement in history-taking skills between 
the two interviews. Finally, all participants completed a survey with Likert 
scale questions and free-text prompts.
RESULTS: Students' history-taking skills - specifically in the domains of 
communication, medical knowledge and professional conduct - on the validated 
rating tool, as evaluated by the independent judges, did not significantly 
improve between their first and second patient interviews. However, students 
rated the dual coaching as overwhelmingly positive (average score of 1.43, with 
1 being Excellent and 5 being Poor), with many appreciating the specificity and 
timeliness of the feedback. Patients also rated the experience very highly 
(average score of 1.23, with 1 being Excellent and 5 being Poor), noting that 
they gained new insights into medical training.
CONCLUSION: Students value receiving immediate and specific feedback and real 
patients enjoy participating in the feedback process. Dual physician-patient 
coaching is a unique way to incorporate more direct observation into 
undergraduate medical education curricula.
