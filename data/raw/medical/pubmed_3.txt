BACKGROUNDS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by 
severe acute respiratory syn-drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The high 
mortality and morbidity rate and its course with a wide variety of clinical 
symptoms indicate that the disease affects many metabolic pathways. The aim of 
our study was to investi-gate the metabolic effects of SARS-CoV-2 by evaluating 
the urinary organic acid profile in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Can 
metabolites in urine guide the diagnosis, follow-up, treatment, and prognosis of 
COVID-19?
METHODS: Forty-two patients, including 30 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients 
and 12 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative controls, were studied. SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR of 
nasopharyngeal swab samples was studied. Urines were evaluated in the 
GCMS-QP2010 SE Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (SHIMADZU) device for organic 
acid profile in the metabolism laboratory. Urine organic acid profile was 
evaluated by studying 117 organic acids in each patient.
RESULTS: Tiglylglycine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, 
3-hydroxypropionic acid, erythro-4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid lactone, 
2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, N-acetyltyrosine, 3-phenyllactic acid, 
5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, 3-hydroxysebacic acid, palmitic acid, 
3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid-oxime, 
3-hydroxysobutyric acid, and organic acids were found to be increased, compared 
to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Tiglylglycine has been specifically identified as a potential 
biomarker of respiratory chain disorders. The deterioration in lipid metabolism 
and pyruvate pathway in COVID-19 patients was evaluated as remarkable.
