Nucleic acid-based vaccines allow scalable, rapid, and cell-free vaccine 
production in response to an emerging disease such as the current COVID-19 
pandemic. Here, we objected to the design of a multiepitope mRNA vaccine against 
the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Through an immunoinformatic approach, 
promising epitopes were predicted for the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), 
and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Fragments rich in overlapping epitopes were 
selected based on binding affinities with HLA classes I and II for the specific 
presentation to B and T lymphocytes. Two constructs were designed by fusing the 
fragments in different arrangements via GG linkers. Construct 1 showed better 
structural properties and interactions with toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), TLR-3, 
and TLR-4 during molecular docking and dynamic simulation. A 50S ribosomal 
L7/L12 adjuvant was added to its N-terminus to improve stability and 
immunogenicity. The final RNA sequence was used to design a trans-amplifying RNA 
(taRNA) vaccine in a split-vector system. It consists of two molecules: a 
nonreplicating RNA encoding a trans-acting replicase to amplify the second one, 
a trans-replicon (TR) RNA encoding the vaccine protein. Overall, the immune 
response simulation detected that activated B and T lymphocytes and increased 
memory cell formation. Macrophages and dendritic cells proliferated 
continuously, and IFN-γ and cytokines like IL-2 were released highly.
