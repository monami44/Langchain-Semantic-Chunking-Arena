BACKGROUND: The stigma associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a 
global problem that causes psychosomatic distress, including depression, 
anxiety, and loneliness. However, few studies have investigated the stigma of 
COVID-19 and the associated mental health impact on children or parents.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at the National Center for 
Child Health and Development in Tokyo, Japan, between November 2021 and October 
2022. Children (4-17 years of age) with COVID-19 and parents of hospitalized 
children (0-17 years of age) with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Children 
with special health-care needs were excluded. The questionnaires on stigma and 
mental health (depression, anxiety, and loneliness) were administered during 
hospitalization and at the 1 month follow-up evaluation after discharge.
RESULTS: During the study period, 47 children and 111 parents were included. 
Thirty-eight children (81%) and 105 parents (95%) answered the questionnaires at 
the 1 month follow up, respectively. Approximately 70% of participants were 
categorized as a high-stigma group. In children, subjective stigma was 
associated with loneliness during hospitalization (mean difference [MD] 2.32; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-4.52) and depression at the 1 month follow up 
(MD 2.44; 95% CI, 0.40-4.48). In parents, presumed stigma was associated with 
depression, anxiety, and loneliness at 1 month follow up (MD 2.24, 1.68, and 
1.15; 95% CI, 0.58-3.89, 0.11-3.25, and 0.08-2.21).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the stigma associated with COVID-19 
continues to affect mental health for more than a month after discharge, and the 
effects of stigma on mental health differed between the children and parents.
