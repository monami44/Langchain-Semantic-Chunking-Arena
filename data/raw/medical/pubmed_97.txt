BACKGROUND: Common cold coronaviruses (ccCoVs) and influenza virus are common 
infectious agents causing upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs). However, 
clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and health effects of ccCoV infection remain 
understudied.
METHODS: A retrospective study evaluated 3,935 outpatients with acute upper RTI 
at a tertiary teaching hospital. The presence of ccCoV and influenza virus was 
determined by multiplex molecular assay. The demographic, clinical symptoms, and 
health outcomes were compared between patients with ccCoV (n = 205) and 
influenza (n = 417) infections. Multivariable logistic regression was employed 
to evaluate predictors and health outcomes over a one-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Sore throat, nasal discharge, headache, and myalgia were more 
predominant in ccCoV infection; fever was common in influenza. Most patients 
reported moderate symptoms severity (49.8% ccCoV, 56.1% influenza). Subsequent 
primary care visits with symptoms of RTI within a year were comparable for both 
infections (27.3% ccCoV vs. 27.6% influenza). However, patients with influenza 
reported increased primary care visits for non-RTI episodes and all-cause 
hospital admission. Baseline comorbidities were associated with increased 
primary care visits with symptoms of RTI in either ccCoV (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-5.9; P = 0.034) or influenza (OR 
1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.1; P = 0.017) infections, due probably to the dysregulation of 
the host immune response following acute infections. In patients infected with 
influenza infection, dyslipidemia was a predictor for subsequent primary care 
visits with symptoms of RTI (unadjusted OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0-3.0; P = 0.040).
CONCLUSIONS: Both influenza and ccCoV infection pose significant disease burden, 
especially in patients with comorbidities. The management of comorbidities 
should be prioritized to mitigate poor health outcomes in infected individuals.
