BACKGROUND: Increasing nosocomial infections during the COVID-19 pandemic have 
been reported. However, data describing peripheral venous catheter associated 
bloodstream infections (PVC-BSI) are limited.
AIMS: To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for PVC-BSI during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We conducted retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected 
PVC-BSI data in a 2100 bed hospital network in Switzerland. Adult patients with 
a PVC inserted between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 were included. Risk 
factors for PVC-BSI were identified through descriptive analysis of patient and 
catheter characteristics, and univariable marginal Cox models.
RESULTS: 206,804 PVCs and 37 PVC-BSI were analysed. Most PVC-BSI were attributed 
to catheters inserted in the Emergency department (76%) or surgical wards (22%). 
PVC-BSI increased in 2021 compared to 2020 (hazard ratio 2021 vs. 2020 = 2.73; 
95% confidence interval 1.19-6.29), with a numerically higher rate 
of Staphylococcus aureus (1/10, 10%, vs. 5/27, 19%) and polymicrobial infection 
(0/10, 0% vs. 4/27, 15%). PVC insertions, patient characteristics, and catheter 
characteristics remained similar across the study period. PVC-BSI risk was 
associated with admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and use of wide 
gauge catheter ( < = 16G).
CONCLUSION: Increased PVC-BSI during the COVID-19 pandemic was not explained by 
catheter or patient factors alone, and may result from system-wide changes. 
PVC-BSI events are primarily attributed to acute care settings, including the 
emergency department, surgical wards, and the ICU.
