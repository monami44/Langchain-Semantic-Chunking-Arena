BACKGROUND: This report summarizes the discussions and conclusions from the 
"Correlates of Protection for Next Generation Influenza Vaccines: Lessons 
Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic" meeting, which took place in Seattle, USA, 
from March 1, 2023, to March 3, 2023.
CONCLUSIONS: Discussions around influenza virus correlates of protection and 
their use continued from where the discussion had been left off in 2019. While 
there was not much progress in the influenza field itself, many lessons learned 
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially the 
importance of mucosal immunity, were discussed and can directly be applied to 
influenza correlates of protection.
