OBJECTIVES: Before vaccines and effective treatments were available, quarantine 
of close contacts was important to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate 
potential benefits and harms of quarantine, we aimed to estimate infection rates 
and describe experiences and mental health among persons in mandated quarantine 
during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
METHODS: We invited adults in mandated quarantine after an exposure to 
SARS-CoV-2 identified through contact tracing of the Canton of Zurich, 
Switzerland, between August 2020 and January 2021. Participants completed two 
questionnaires and received up to two SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction 
tests, during and at the end of quarantine.
RESULTS: Among 395 participants, quarantine duration ranged from 2 to 20 days. 
By day 11 since the last contact, 11.1% [95% CI 8.4%-14.7%] were infected with 
SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of participants with symptoms of depression doubled 
from 9.3% before quarantine to 18.9% during quarantine, and 12.1% reported 
quarantine was very or extremely difficult.
CONCLUSION: Although quarantine was only moderately burdensome for most 
participants, some experienced significant difficulties and burden. Policymakers 
need to balance infection control with potential harms placed on individuals.
