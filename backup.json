                "During the study period, 266 patients (mean, 14.9 patients per month) presented before the declaration of COVID-19 as a national emergency on March 13, 2020, while 236 patients (mean, 25.9 patients per month) presented afterward, representing a 74.6% increase in victim-of-crime patients treated.",
                "Interactions with TRS decreased during the COVID-19 period, with an average of 3.0 interactions per patient before COVID-19 versus 1.9 after emergency declaration (P<0.01). Similarly, reductions in length of stay were noted; the pre-COVID-19 average was 3.6 days, compared to 2.1 days post-COVID-19 (P<0.01).",

Excess emissions peaked in October 2021 at 23 tons of NOx per day and 2001 tons of CO2 per day.",

METHODS Data were collected from 788 American adults across three periods during Spring-Summer 2020 using MTurk. Latent growth curve modeling examined whether hope and optimism predicted COVID stress, health anxiety, and wellbeing trajectories.",
                "RESULTS COVID stress and health anxiety decreased after the onset of the pandemic, whereas wellbeing was stable. Individually, hope and optimism predicted lower initial COVID stress and health anxiety, along with greater initial wellbeing. When examining the combined influence of hope and optimism, optimism was more strongly related to health-focused distress, though both were strong predictors of wellbeing.",
                "CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that Americans were resilient and positive expectancies, particularly optimism, predicted better initial adjustment to the early phases of the pandemic. Thus, positive expectancies appear to be protective during a global health crisis."

                "This study aims to examine the thyroid hormone profile and its association with severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2. METHODS This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted to a tertiary hospital due to SARSCoV2 infection between February 18 and May 18, 2022. Clinical data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical record system. Based on the thyroid function, patients were divided into five groups normal, nonthyroid illness syndrome NTIS, hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, and unclassified. The association between thyroid function and severe COVID19 was detected using multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic splines analysis.",

After adjusting for age, sex, and relevant clinical characteristics, NTIS and hypothyroidism were associated with increased risks of severe COVID19 odds ratio OR 2.38, 95 confidence interval CI 1.593.56 and OR 2.29, 95 CI 1.234.26, respectively, compared to normal thyroid function group.",

CONCLUSION Thyroid hormone profiles of NTIS or hypothyroidism are associated with increased risks of severe COVID19. The decreased level of TT3 correlated with the increased risk of severe COVID19 in patients with NTIS or hypothyroidism."

Agreement among practicing physicians with consensus statements was also assessed via an online physician survey. The strength of the consensus was determined by the following rating system a strong rating was defined as all four key opinion leaders KOLs rating the statement 8, a moderate rating was defined as three out of four KOLs rating the statement 8, and no consensus was defined as less than three out of four KOLs provided a rating of 8.",

Experts agreed that COVID19 vaccines are safe, effective, and well tolerated by patients with rheumatological conditions, renal disease, hematologic malignancy, and recipients of solid organ transplants.

The olfactory nerve is widely accepted as the neuroinvasive route by which the etiological agent SARSCoV2 enters the brain, but the trigeminal nerve is an oftenoverlooked additional route.",

Despite the extensive viral infection across the brain, obvious evidence of tissue pathology including inflammatory infiltration, glial activation, and apoptotic cell deaths were not consistently observed, albeit inflammatory cytokines were significantly induced.",

                "In this paper two models of bias learning or equivalently, learning to learn are introduced and the main theoretical results presented.",
                "The first model is a PACtype model based on empirical process theory, while the second is a hierarchical Bayes model.",
                "Typically the bias is supplied by hand, for example through the choice of an appropriate set of features. However, if the learning machine is embedded within an environment of related tasks, then it can learn its own bias by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment."
