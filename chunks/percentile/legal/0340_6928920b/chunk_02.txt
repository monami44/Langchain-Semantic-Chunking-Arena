Jones, ed., 2012, hereinafter cited as The Habitats Directive 2012. A consolidated text of the Directive and its annexes is appended to the book at 253318.4 For a situation in which the semblance of implementation appears to be absent, see G. KÃ¼tting, Nature Conservation Law in Context The Limited Influence of European Union and Greek Designations on the Future of Cavo Sidero, Crete, 15 J. Intl Wildlife L. Poly 6079 2012. It is important to note that EU Directives are implemented at the discretion of member states and in accordance with the domestic policies of each state. In those states, then, where there is no substantial body of wellestablished and wellobserved rules and regulations governing land use planning and decision making, and especially governing the impacts of land development on habitats and species, implementation of the Directives is bound to be to some degree laggard. It is a hallmark of the literature on the Directives that it deals for the most part with member states where the implementation deficit is relatively modest, such as the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, and France. This is, of course, useful, but a poor guide to the outcomes implementation produces in, say, Greece, Italy, and even Ireland. See the sources cited in note 14, infra.5 Council of Europe, 1979.
