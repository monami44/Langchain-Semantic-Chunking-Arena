The paper tackles a widely discussed but still rather underresearched area of asylum and immigration law, more precisely its procedural aspects and its interactions within the public administration and administrative judiciary. It contributes to the debate about the Europeanization of public administration within the specific context of asylum and immigration law.The purpose of the paper is to examine the influence of European Union law on the legal regulation of administrative and judicial review of decisions rendered in asylum and immigration procedures.The research is based on an indepth analysis of the dynamics of amendments and the motivation of national legislation while adopting new procedural rules in the abovementioned areas on the case of the Czech Republic based on the description and analysis of the legal regulation, explanatory memoranda and the case law, supplemented with certain comparative aspects. The procedural autonomy principle gets increasingly limited by other principles, namely the effectiveness principle and the principle of effective judicial protection.
