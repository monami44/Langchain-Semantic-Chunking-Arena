In this article we explore how much state is necessary to make governance work. We begin by clarifying concepts of governance and the shadow of hierarchy and we follow this clarification with a brief overview of empirical findings on governance research in developed countries. We then discuss the dilemmas for governance in areas of limited statehood, where political institutions are too weak to hierarchically adopt and enforce collectively binding rules.
