L. 59 2009.47 Clutten Tafur, supra note 34 at 176.48 Id. at 179.49 The Sweetman litigation stems from the grant of permission by the Irish Planning Board in 2008 for a road project, the Galway outer city bypass. Part of the project would by all accounts destroy about 1.5 hectares of limestone pavement to be protected in a proposed candidate addition to the Lough Corrib Special Area of Conservation. The case figures prominently in Gregory Jones, Adverse Effects on the Integrity of a European Site Some Unanswered Questions, in The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3, 151 at 158166.
