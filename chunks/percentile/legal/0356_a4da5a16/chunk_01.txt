Abstract In the last decades, an increasing number of EU institutions and agencies have been given the power to conduct administrative inspections. While the legal literature has traditionally focused on the Commissions inspection powers in competition proceedings, the European AntiFraud Office OLAF, the European Central Bank ECB, the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA, the European Aviation Safety Agency EASA, and the European Fisheries Control Agency EFCA are also entrusted with such powers. The Commission has also been granted inspection powers in the field of Food Safety.
