Cryopreservation of reproductive material has dramatically improved clinical outcomes for patients all over the world. At the same time the practice has produced significant legal, ethical, and practical challenges to physicians and practices who use this technique. Failing to meet the expectations of patients, for example by losing material because of a freezer failure, has significant implications for the reproductive facility. Similarly, improperly transporting or receiving gametes or embryos can result in substantial risk to a practice. Perhaps the most widely publicized conundrum is how best to manage embryos that are abandoned. This paper will describe the legal principles and best practices that should be incorporated into the management of a fertility cryopreservation program.

Van Robays J. Artificial insemination history hurdles and milestones.Facts Views Vis Obgyn. 2015 7 137143PubMed Google Scholar. Since that time, cryopreservation advances have improved the use of artificial insemination and, in the 1980s, affected human pregnancy potential, and the field of reproductive medicine, dramatically with the introduction of human embryo cryopreservation. The first pregnancy was established in 1983 2Trounson A. Mohr L.

Fast forward another decade, and reproductive medicine achieved and accepted oocyte freezing as another tool to enhance fertility treatment. Today, improved processes of cryopreservation or freezing as it is commonly known of human sperm, oocytes, and embryos, using vitrification to reduce freezing time and improve survival rates 4Konc J.
