Abstract The rule of law is a value on which the European Union is founded, and which shall be respected and observed by its Member States. This value is not merely an ethical standard but a binding legal principle that is applicable to legal disputes under Union law. The treaties, however, do not provide a definition of this principle. From a Union law perspective, it is therefore indispensable to determine the rule of law more precisely not only is it referred to in treaty law Article 2 TEU, but understood by Union courts as a constitutional metaprinciple that informs other constitutional norms and may justify review proceedings and sanctions against Member States. The Commission Framework to strengthen the Rule of Law of 2014 does not suffice to shape a Union rule of law. It relies primarily on the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
