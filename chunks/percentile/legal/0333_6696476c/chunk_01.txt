Social impact assessment SIA is now conceived as being the process of managing the social issues of development. There is consensus on what good SIA practice is it is participatory it supports affected peoples, proponents and regulatory agencies it increases understanding of change and capacities to respond to change it seeks to avoid and mitigate negative impacts and to enhance positive benefits across the life cycle of developments and it emphasizes enhancing the lives of vulnerable and disadvantaged people. We analyse the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing SIA. We assert that the SIA community needs to revisit core concepts, such as culture, community, power, human rights, gender, justice, place, resilience and sustainable livelihoods.
