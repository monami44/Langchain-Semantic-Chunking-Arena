Although individual medical decisions taken collectively have implications for distributive justice and resource allocation, it is not the responsibility of clinicians, patients, or families to directly factor these global considerations into individual decisions.14 Rather, discussions regarding alternative treatment options, including no treatment, should be focused on meeting a specific individuals values, goals, and preferences within the context of societal rules and regulations.Why Advanced Heart Failure?Heart failure affects 2.4 of the adult population and over 11 of the expanding population 80 years old.15 Estimated total heart failure costs in the United States are projected to reach 44.6 billion by 2015.15 Existing therapies slow, but infrequently reverse, disease progression. As a result, the prevalence of symptomatic heart failure has increased, including a prolongation of the advanced phase of the disease.16 The American Heart Association characterizes the far end of the heart failure continuum as stage D, or refractory endstage heart failure,17 further defined by others,18,19 including the European Society of Cardiology Table 2.20 These overlapping definitions describe a group of patients for whom symptoms limit daily life despite usual recommended therapies and for whom lasting remission into less symptomatic disease is unlikely. The increasing prevalence, high symptom burden, and possible diseaseexchanging therapies ie, transplantation and mechanical circulatory support for patients living with advanced heart failure mandate a systematic and thoughtful approach to decision making.Table 2.

Its goal is primarily to help healthcare providers of all types integrate these concepts into their routine practice to promote the delivery of effective, safe, efficient, timely, equitable, and patientcentered care.12 We recognize that major barriers to the implementation of these concepts are time, training, and resources. We also recognize the limited and inequitable access to experts with formal training in heart failure and palliative care, which leaves many of these responsibilities to be borne by healthcare providers in a general medical setting. If the goals of this document are to be realized, however, the healthcare system will need to make a fundamental commitment to shared decision making, with realignment of incentives to support the tailoring of advanced care to individual patients. Without changes in the structure of the healthcare team and associated reimbursement, these recommendations will remain an unfunded mandate that are unlikely to be fully realized in most practice settings.Expectations for the FutureAttention to the clinical trajectory is required to calibrate expectations and guide timely decisions.Predictive models can target highrisk populations but leave wide uncertainties around estimates of survival for an individual.Difficult discussions now will simplify difficult decisions in the future.Uncertainty is inevitable and should be included in discussions with patients and family.Estimating Prognosis in Heart FailureAssessment of prognosis is the foundation for selection among therapies for lifethreatening disease, but this is particularly challenging for heart failure. The clinical course varies dramatically across the spectrum of disease severity and is relatively unpredictable for individual patients Figure 1.19,21 This contrasts with the more linear decline of patients with advanced cancer, which has traditionally been the model for approaches to endstage disease. Even late in heart failure, patients often enjoy good days and brief interludes of apparent stability, which can lull them and their care providers into postponing vital decisions. Prognosis is further clouded by the unique contrast between unexpected sudden death ie, lethal arrhythmia and lingering death with congestive symptoms ie, progressive pump failure. Frequent reappraisal of the clinical trajectory helps calibrate expectations, guide communication, and inform rational decisions.Download figureDownload PowerPointFigure 1. A depiction of the clinical course of heart failure with associated types and intensities of available therapies. Black line Patients tend to follow a progressive, albeit nonlinear, decline in healthrelated quality of life as the disease progresses this course can be interrupted by sudden cardiac death caused by arrhythmia or can end in a more gradual death caused by progressive pump failure. Gray line At disease onset, multiple oral therapies are prescribed for cardiac dysfunction andor treatment of comorbidities. As disease severity increases, the intensity of care may increase in parallel, with intensification of diuretics, addition of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillatorcardiac resynchronization therapy for those eligible, and increasing interaction with the medical system through ambulatory visits and hospitalizations, until the time when standard therapies begin to fail transition to advanced heart failure. Dotted line Palliative therapies to control symptoms, address quality of life, and enhance communication are relevant throughout the course of heart failure, not just in advanced disease palliative therapies work hand in hand with traditional therapies designed to prolong survival. The critical transition into advanced heart failure from the medical perspective is often followed by a transition in goals of care from the patient and family perspective, wherein palliative therapies may become the dominant treatment paradigm for the majority of patients in whom transplantation and mechanical circulatory support are not an option. Clinicians must recognize the transition to advanced heart failure so that therapeutic options can be considered in a timely fashion and patients are able to proactively match medical decisions to clinical realities.

The most commonly used multivariable instruments for estimating prognosis in symptomatic outpatients are the Heart Failure Survival Score23 and the Seattle Heart Failure Model.22 In patients hospitalized for heart failure, a variety of inpatient models have been developed to predict both inhospital28 and postdischarge outcomes.26,27,2931 These inpatient models have highlighted the strength of natriuretic peptides, renal function, and low blood pressure as predictors of survival in patients in this setting.24 Recently, the first model to predict both mortality and qualityoflife outcomes after discharge has been published.32 Although all of these models require complex mathematical formulas to generate risks, the increasing use of health information technology in the delivery of care offers the potential to automatically generate risk profiles from the electronic medical record.Table 3.

Multiple studies have documented patients willingness to sacrifice survival in exchange for symptom relief, a tradeoff that varies between patients and within the same patient over time and is correlated loosely with disease severity39,40 but strongly with donotresuscitate status.41 A full discussion of prognosis therefore includes not only the risks of death but also the potential burdens of worsening symptoms, limited functional capacity, loss of independence, reduced social functioning, decreased quality of life, and increased caregiver commitment.42 Unfortunately, much less is known about the risks of these latter outcomes.
