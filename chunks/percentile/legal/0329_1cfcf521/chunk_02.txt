During the last two decades, Switzerland has concluded more than 15 bilateral agreements in various policy fields. It has thus reached a level of integration that can be characterized as customized quasimembership Kriesi and Trechsel 2008 189. This, in turn, has had farreaching consequences at the domestic level. Switzerland is, therefore, a case worth considering for scholars interested in the Europeanization of policymaking. Not surprisingly, then, there are countless contributions on the impact of EUrelated factors on Swiss politics and policy outputs for an overview see Fischer 2007. Twenty years after the popular rejection of the EEA, it is time to take stock of these contributions and to make their findings available to a wider audience. What do we know about the Europeanization of Swiss policymaking? This is the opening question of this debate. The international literature on Europeanization has demonstrated a strong preference for qualitative studies over quantitative studies Exadaktylos and Radaelli 2012b. This also holds for Switzerland. A number of smallN studies2 have provided insights into the effects on Swiss decisionmaking processes and on related power relations, conflict and coalition among domestic actors. Legal scholars, for their part, have discussed how and to which extent EU norms influence the Swiss legal order Epiney 2009. LargeN studies are scarcer, and they have mainly focused on legislation. More specifically, authors have adopted a quantitative approach to measure how much Swiss legislation is Europeanized, and to establish causal links between EU factors and domestic policies Arbia 2008, Gava and Varone 2012, Jenni 2013, Kohler 2009, Linder et al. 2009, Mallepell 1999.
