While Switzerland is strongly integrated in the EU, it still stands apart as a nonEU and nonEEA country. In a comparative perspective, it thus offers variation on a crucial institutional variable, namely nonmembership to these two European supranational organizations. Switzerland appears consequently as a valuable control case for crossnational inquiries that aim at identifying the effects of the EU on national political systems and outcomes Bartle 2006, Fontana et al. 2008, Haverland 2007, LeviFaur 2004. Differences in the extent of Europeanization within the country, with some policy fields strongly affected and others largely immune from EUdriven influence, further motivate the comparison of Europeanization effects across policy fields in Switzerland e.g. Papadopoulos 2008, Sciarini et al. 2004. In the EU, there is a strong preference for studying the policy effects of Europeanization, whereas there is definitely less intellectual appetite for appraising the politics dimension Exadaktylos and Radaelli 2012a 24. Switzerland tends to depart in that respect as several studies have dealt with decisionmaking processes and have focused on the related politics and, to some extent, polity dimensions. Against this background, the purpose of this Debate is threefold.
