Direct democracy is a longstanding feature of the Swiss constitutional system, but is increasingly being deployed in ways that threaten basic commitments to constitutional democracy in Switzerland. This article considers possible constitutional responses to this problem, and in particular whether there is scope for an unconstitutional amendment doctrine UCA to constrain the scope of popular initiatives in Switzerland. It suggests limited legal and politicalcultural support for a substantive or strong UCA in Switzerland, given the tradition of relatively narrow and weak judicial review by the Swiss Supreme Court.
