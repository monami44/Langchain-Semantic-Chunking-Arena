The analysis proceeds as follows. Part I considers alternative approaches to addressing related party transactions between a controlling shareholder and a corporation with minority shareholders selfdealing may be addressed ex ante through structural prohibitions on the characteristics associated with private benefits. Alternatively, it can be addressed ex post by substantive review of the terms of related transactions. Part II then shifts attention to the role of courts The effectiveness of a statutory strategy will depend on the quality and experience of the associated courts. Part III then reprises the argument that harmonization of the quality of judicial enforcement of corporate statutes may be more important than harmonization of the substantive law. In this respect, an EU level company court into whose jurisdiction a corporation may opt into is powerfully complement to a model company act. Recognizing that an optional E.U. level company law court is may not be established however powerful the supporting logic, Part III then endorses Michael Klausners soft law approach in this volume to providing some of the benefits of a sophisticated company law court available to all member state companies through on ongoing role for the EMCA drafters.
