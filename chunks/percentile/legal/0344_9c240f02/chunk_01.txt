The article will examine the challenges that the establishment of the European Public Prosecutors Office poses for the rule of law a question which has been underexplored in the policy and academic debate on the establishment of the EPPO, which focused largely on questions of structure and powers of the EPPO and the battle between intergovernmental and supranational visions of European prosecution. The implications of the finally adopted legal framework on the EPPO on the rule of law will be analysed primarily from the perspective of the rule of law as related to EPPO investigations and prosecutions and their consequences for affected individuals in terms of legal certainty and foreseeability, protection from executive arbitrariness, effective judicial protection and defence rights.
