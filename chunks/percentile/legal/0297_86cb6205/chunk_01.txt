Standards enter the European legal order in a variety of ways which affect their judicial review. Notably, international standards are sometimes incorporated by reproduction in binding or nonbinding EU measures, or they penetrate the European legal order through the technique of referral, whereby the text of the standards is referred to in EU secondary law. The aim of this contribution is to examine the different techniques through which standards enter the European legal order and evaluate the way in which the Court of Justice of the European Union may judicially review the standards. The chapter will show that the Court of Justice currently has a lovehate relationship with standards.
