Abstract The EUs Common Foreign and Security Policy CFSP was conceived of as an area illsuited for full judicial review by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Lisbon Treaty confers on the Court limited jurisdiction which the recent case law has interpreted in broad terms. This article will place this case law in the broader constitutional setting of the EU legal order and will provide a critical analysis of its implications for both the EUs and domestic courts.
