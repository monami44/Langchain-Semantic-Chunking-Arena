But while I am not unsympathetic to this approach, for our purposes it seems needlessly restrictive. If, as I suggested, the internal logic of democratic constitutionalism that Habermas reconstructs in his system of rights travels beyond the West without being a mere topdown imposition with imperial intent, perhaps we need not limit our analysis of democratic regressions to our own order. A more fruitful direction is to modify ones conception of progress. In recent critical theory, the question of how a broadly applicable, nonEurocentric understanding of progress might look like has been usefully approached by framing progress in nonteleological, formal, and negativistic terms Allen, 2016 Jaeggi, 2018 Verov≈°ek, 2019. Progress, it has been suggested, is imaginable without assuming that progressive developments have a particular final goal a rejection of teleology, nor need a generalized notion of progress stipulate any particular substantive outcomes that dynamics of sociopolitical change need to generate in order to count as progressive a formal, rather than substantive, view. Instead, it may be possible to think of progress simply as part of an accumulative problemsolving process that is not hampered by moments of regression a negativistic take on the identification of progress Jaeggi, 2018, p. 36 also see Kitcher, 2021, pp.
