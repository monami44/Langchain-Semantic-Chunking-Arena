In this paper we describe the two population registers and analyse their strengths and weaknesses. Virtually 100 of births and deaths, 95 of immigrations and 91 of emigrations are reported to the Population Registers within 30 days and with a higher proportion over time. The overcoverage of the TPR, which is primarily due to underreported emigration data, has been estimated at up to 0.5 of the Swedish population. Through the personal identity number, assigned to all residents staying at least 1 year in Sweden, data from the TPR can be used for medical research purposes, including family design studies since each individual can be linked to his or her parents, siblings and offspring. The TPR also allows for identification of general population controls, participants in cohort studies, as well as calculation of followup time.
