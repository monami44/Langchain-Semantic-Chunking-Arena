Consequently, grinding of bones as shortly prior to DNA extraction was recommended. The goal of our study was to explore the difference in DNA yield between bone fragment and bone powder frozen for 10 years. 57 WWII femurs were examined and DNA extracted from each of them using bone fragment piece sampled next to the one used in 2009 and bone powder obtained in 2009, both taken out of freezer after 10 years of storage. Half gram of bone powder was decalcified using full demineralization extraction method. The DNA was purified in a Biorobot EZ1 Qiagen and quantified with PowerQuant kit Promega. Statistical analysis showed significant difference at the 0.05 level in DNA yield comparing fragments of bones and bone powder stored at 20 C for 10 years. The results show there is more DNA stored in the bone powder than in the bone fragments. Because of time consuming powdering procedure we recommend to store not only the fragment of the bone, but obtained bone powder as well.
