Prior to powdering bones and teeth, we removed contaminants. We decalcified 0.5 g bone and tooth powder followed by extraction and purification of DNA using Biorobot EZ1 Qiagen. Quantification of obtained nuclear DNA was carried out using PowerQuant kit Promega and autosomal STR typing using ESSplex SE QS kit Qiagen. Best parameters to assess skeletal elements that are superior in their DNA preservation were quantity of DNA and number of successfully typed STR loci. Metacarpal and metatarsal bones proved to be the best, followed by intermediate cuneiform, first distal foot phalanx, talus, petrous bone and tibia. We also created elimination database for persons involved in exhumation, anthropological and genetic analyses and exclude potential contamination.
