The narratives of these deeply traumatic experiences have long been neglected and suppressed in Finland and have been studied only recently by academics and acknowledged in public. In this text, we analyze the interviews with four elders of one Sámi village, Vuotso. We explore their memories, from a childs perspective, scrutinizing the narration as a multilayered affective process that involves sensual and embodied dimensions of memory.
