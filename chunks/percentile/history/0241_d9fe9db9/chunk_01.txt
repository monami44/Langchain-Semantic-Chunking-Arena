The genetic identification of skeletal remains found in Second World War mass graves is complicated because of the poor quality of the samples. The aim of this study was to set up a workflow for STR typing of such samples combining PCRCE and PCRNGS technologies. To this end, 57 DNA samples from an equal number of 75yearold femurs were studied. After a first round of PCR typing using GlobalFiler CE, 42 samples yielded a full profile and were therefore submitted to our standard workflow. The 15 samples that yielded no or a limited number 21721 of autosomal STR markers as well four bone control samples that provided a full profile with the conventional PCRCE test were typed in duplicate by the GlobalFiler NGS kit. Despite the degradation of the samples, which resulted in lower coverage and a lower of ontarget reads, reliable sequencing data were obtained from 1619 samples. The use of a threshold of 30 for the locus call led to a consensus profile cp of 203131 STR autosomal loci in 10 samples and to a cp of 81031 loci in two samples, whereas the four control samples yielded a cp of 263131 loci. Finally, the data of the NGS typing were combined with those of the CE typing.
