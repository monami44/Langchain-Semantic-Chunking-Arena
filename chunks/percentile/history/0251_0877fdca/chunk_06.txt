According to Yrjö Varpio and contrary to popular beliefs, Linna himself accepted this idea and it was not a nationalistic retouch of his novel by Laine. 24 Varpio, Väinö Linnan elämä, 340 Raittila, Jätkäpojan linja, 1011. 25 Kinnunen, Gender and Politics, 1935. 26 In 1985, director Rauni Mollberg filmed a new version of The Unknown Soldier, the spirit of which is much more strongly antiwar, and which emphasizes the futility of soldiers sacrifices. It is telling that this film is rarely shown on television, and the Independence Day spectacle is reserved for Edvin Laines less violent and more patriotic version. 27 Varpio, Väinö Linnan elämä, 294, 64046 on the myth of war experience and Finnish masculinity, see Ahlbäck and Kivimäki, Masculinities at War, 1267. 28 Kettunen, Tuntematon sotilas, 119. 29 See Kinnunen and Jokisipilä, Shifting Images, 4478. 30 Vihavainen, Kansakunta rähmällään, 2225. 31 See, e.g., Juujärvi, Pesso, and Salin, Sotiemme veteraanien identiteetti, 2632, 759. 32 Cf.

At the same time in the 1960s, the abovementioned lotta debate was also revisited, as the novel Sissiluutnantti 1963 by Paavo Rintala again raised questions of lottas reputation and honour Kinnunen, Gender and Politics, 1935. 34 See, e.g., Herzog, Sex after Fascism. 35 Sulamaa, Himmetä ei muistot koskaan saa, 297311. 36 Ukkola, Sodan jälkeen, 35. 37 On the term neopatriotism in this context, see Vares, Kuitenkin me voitimme!. 38 Sulamaa, Veteraania ei jätetä, 4363 Tuomisto, Etulinjassa, 100140. 39 Miettunen, Menneisyys ja historiakuva, passim. 40 Apparently, the Soviet authorities considered the magazine as revanchist, but this did not disturb its publication Rautkallio, Politik und Volk, 206. 41 Sulamaa, Himmetä ei muistot koskaan saa, 3023 editorial, Kansa taisteli, no. 5 1986 147. 42 On the Finnish readership of war literature until the end of 1980s, Niemi, Viime sotien kirjat, 194203. 43 From 1945 until the 1970s, the social democrats and the peoples democrats gained about 45 of the vote in national elections today, the comparable share of the left is less than 30. 44 A division into bourgeois and workingclass unions would only be true as a general characterization. In practice, both unions tended to lean towards the centre and the local differences between the unions were often quite unclear and complicated, see Sulamaa, Veteraania ei jätetä, 402, 1919 Tuomisto, Etulinjassa, 838, 11317. 45 These key war veteran figures, close to President Kekkonen and active in the Finnish foreign policy of the 1970s, included, for instance, longtime prime and foreign minister Ahti Karjalainen, twotime prime minister and later president Mauno Koivisto, and foreign minister albeit for a rather short period Väinö Leskinen. 46 The complexity of the issue can be illustrated by the fact that probably the two most despised Finnish politicians among the hardcore communist youth radicals of the 1970s were indeed war veterans, Aarne Saarinen and Ele Alenius, but Saarinen also happened to be the chairman of the Finnish Communist Party and Alenius the leader of the peoples democrats. Eino S. Repo, the head of the Finnish Broadcasting Company in the 1960s and allegedly responsible for its radicalization, had also been a frontline officer. 47 Juujärvi, Pesso, and Salin, Sotiemme veteraanien identiteetti, 846. 48 Jokisipilä, Kappas vaan, saksalaisia this debate is so longlasting and nuanced that it is not fruitful to describe it here in detail for summaries in German and English, see Kinnunen, Finnische Kriegserinnerung Meinander, A Separate Story Jokisipilä, Finnish History Culture and Kivimäki, Three Wars and Their Epitaphs. 49 Junila, Kotirintaman aseveljeyttä, 312, 82, 13646, 286304.
