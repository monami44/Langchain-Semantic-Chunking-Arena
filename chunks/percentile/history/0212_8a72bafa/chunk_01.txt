To this day process of identification of missing persons from skeletonized human remains with help of forensic genetics proves to be complex and challenging. The success rate of genetic identification in bones strongly depends on a combination of various factors, most importantly environmental factors and postmortem interval. Furthermore, there are individualspecific factors that affect DNA preservation, such as race, gender, age and type of skeletal elements. The goal of our study was to optimize sampling process through determining which skeletal elements are superior in their preservation of DNA in 70yearold skeletons belonging to victims of Second World War. We sampled different types of bones and teeth from three such skeletons found in Slovenian hidden mass grave Huda jama, 56 elements from each respective skeleton, together 168 elements. With the help of parameters, such as quantity of DNA, degradation rate and typing success, we tried to find the best types of elements to identify the victims.
