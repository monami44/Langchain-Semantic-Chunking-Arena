This last task allowed us to recover on average three alleles per sample and to increase the number of the heterozygous patterns in 37 cases. In total, the combined approach proposed here made possible the genetic typing of 65100 of the autosomal STR markers in 1015 66.6 skeletal remains that yielded no or very poor results with the conventional PCRCE approach. However, because several artefacts such as allelic dropout and allelic dropin were scored, the risk of mistyping cannot be neglected.
