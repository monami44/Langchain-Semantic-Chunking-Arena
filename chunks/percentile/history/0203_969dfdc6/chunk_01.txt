Bone samples may yield lowquality and lowquantity DNA and duplicated analyses of different genetic markers have to be performed for identification of missing persons. Mostly no DNA extract is left after analyses and efficient storage of bones is needed to ensure the stability of the sample over time for retesting using new markers and new technologies. Usually not all of the bone powder prepared in grinder is used for extraction and rest can be stored for future analyses. After molecular genetic analyses of 88 victims of Second World War WWII Konfin I mass grave in Slovenia performed in 2009, fragments of femurs and bone powder that were left were stored at 20 C. Some authors reported that longterm storage of powder results in the reduction of DNA preservation and its degradation even at low temperature, explained by an increase in oxidative damage as a result of the enormous increase in exposed surface area.
