Adverse childhood experiences might have longlasting effects on decisions under uncertainty in adult life. Merging the European Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement with data on conflict events during the Second World War, and relying on regionbycohort variation in war exposure, we show that warfare exposure during childhood is associated with lower financial risk taking in later life. Individuals who experienced war episodes as children hold less and are less likely to hold stocks, but are more likely to hold life insurance, compared to nonexposed individuals.
