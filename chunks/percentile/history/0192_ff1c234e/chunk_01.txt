This paper describes molecular genetic identification of one third of the skeletal remains of 88 victims of postwar June 1945 killings found in the Konfin I mass grave in Slovenia. Living relatives were traced for 36 victims. We analyzed 84 right femurs and compared their genetic profiles to the genetic material of living relatives. We cleaned the bones, removed surface contamination, and ground the bones into powder. Prior to DNA isolation using Biorobot EZ1 Qiagen, the powder was decalcified. The nuclear DNA of the samples was quantified using the realtime polymerase chain reaction method.
