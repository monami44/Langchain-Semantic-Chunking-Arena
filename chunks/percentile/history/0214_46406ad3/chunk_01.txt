Abstract This article offers a transnational account of the historical origins and development of the concept of global psyche and transcultural psychiatry. It argues that the concept of universal, global psyche emerged in the aftermath of the Second World War and during decolonization, when West European psychiatry strove to leave behind its colonial legacies and lay the foundation for a more inclusive conversation between Western and nonWestern mental health communities.
