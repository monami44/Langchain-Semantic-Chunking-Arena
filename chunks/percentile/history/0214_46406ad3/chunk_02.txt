The article explores this farreaching psychiatric, social and cultural search for a new definition of common humanity, relating it to the social and political history of decolonization, and to the postwar reconstruction and search for stable peace. It provides a transnational account of a series of interlinked developments and trends around the world in order to arrive at a global history of the decolonization of mental health science.
