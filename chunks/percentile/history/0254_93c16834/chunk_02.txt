With the passing of time, such army should have been reduced, and there should have been a progressive growth of the bargaining power of labour trade unions. However, the empirical evidence shows that the strength of labour trade union measured, at least, as number of members decreased for all the 1950s. Notwithstanding, the gap between productivity and real wage growth tend to close. This paper tries to explain this process focussing, instead on the labour supply side, on the labour demand side, in particular on the evolution of the bargaining power of the industrial firm trade union, Confindustria. In effect, in the 1950s, Confindustria was a compact union, which represented almost exclusively the few big industries present in the country. With the entry of Italy in the European Economic Community and the following period of high exports and growth, the number of firms members of Confindustria increased significantly. Given the increasing disparity of interests of members, the compactness of Confindustria broke up its bargaining power decreased. Based on this ascertainment, the paper explains the increase in real wages recorded in the 1950s with the decrease in the firms monopsony power. Such explanation is done using a neoclassical growth model with intraindustry trade and monopsony in the labour market. The model offers two results. First, an increase in the steady state capital stock, due for example to trade liberalization, leads to an increase in the labour share of income. Second, the effect of growth on the income labour share is higher at the early stage of development.
