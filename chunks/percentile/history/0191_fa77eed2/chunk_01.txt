This title was selected for Guardian books of the year. The familiar image of the British in the Second World War is that of the plucky underdog taking on German might. David Edgertons bold, compelling new history shows the conflict in a new light, with Britain as a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system. The British, indeed Churchillian, vision of war and modernity was challenged by repeated defeat by less well equipped enemies. Yet the end result was a vindication of this vision.
