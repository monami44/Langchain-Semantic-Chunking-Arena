It finds that the once dominant trope of national victimization no longer represents the main thrust in the Chinese Communist Partys CCP rhetoric on the Second World War. Under Xi Jinping, this has been replaced by a selfassertive and aspirational narrative of national victory and national greatness, designed to enhance Beijings legitimacy and advance its domestic and foreign policy objectives. By emphasizing national unity and CCPKMT cooperation, the new narrative offers an inclusive and unifying interpretation of Chinas war effort in which the victory in 1945 has come to rival the 1949 revolution as the critical turning point towards national rejuvenation. The increasingly Sinocentric and centrally controlled narrative holds implicit warnings to those challenging Beijings claim to greatness.
