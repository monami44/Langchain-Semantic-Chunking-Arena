Abstract Sexual policies were a core component of the National Socialist racial policies, both in the Altreich territories considered part of Nazi Germany before 1938, as well as in the occupied territories. In occupied Poland the Germans imposed a prohibition of contact Umgangsverbot with the local Polish population, a restriction that covered both social as well as sexual encounters. But this model of absolute racial segregation was never truly implemented.
