In this paper, we review and organize practical machine learning safety techniques that can complement engineering safety for machine learning based software in autonomous vehicles. Our organization maps safety strategies to stateoftheart machine learning techniques in order to enhance dependability and safety of machine learning algorithms. We also discuss security limitations and user experience aspects of machine learning components in autonomous vehicles.
