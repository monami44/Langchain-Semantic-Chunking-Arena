The paper stresses more on the first level of What to learn?, or Learning Target Selection. Towards this primary problem within the four levels, I briefly review the existing studies about the connection between information theoretical learning ITL 1 and machine learning. A theorem is given on the relation between the empiricallydefined similarity measure and information measures. Finally, a conjecture is proposed for pursuing a unified mathematical interpretation to learning target selection.
