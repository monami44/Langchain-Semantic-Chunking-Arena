This paper provides a first study of utilizing energy harvesting for sustainable machine learning in distributed networks. We consider a distributed learning setup in which a machine learning model is trained over a large number of devices that can harvest energy from the ambient environment, and develop a practical learning framework with theoretical convergence guarantees. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the proposed framework can significantly outperform energyagnostic benchmarks.
