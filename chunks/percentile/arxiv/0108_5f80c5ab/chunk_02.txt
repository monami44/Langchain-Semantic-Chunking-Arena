How good, then, are current machine learning clouds on realworld machine learning workloads? We study this question with a focus on binary classication problems. We present mlbench, a novel benchmark constructed by harvesting datasets from Kaggle competitions. We then compare the performance of the top winning code available from Kaggle with that of running machine learning clouds from both Azure and Amazon on mlbench. Our comparative study reveals the strength and weakness of existing machine learning clouds and points out potential future directions for improvement.
