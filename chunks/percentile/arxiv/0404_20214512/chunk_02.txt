In the present survey, several promising avenues of research will be examined which focus on the combination of machine learning ML and domain decomposition methods DDMs. The aim of this survey is to provide an overview of existing work within this field and to structure it into domain decomposition for machine learning and machine learningenhanced domain decomposition, including domain decomposition for classical machine learning, domain decomposition to accelerate the training of physicsaware neural networks, machine learning to enhance the convergence properties or computational efficiency of DDMs, and machine learning as a discretization method in a DDM for the solution of PDEs. In each of these fields, we summarize existing work and key advances within a common framework and, finally, disuss ongoing challenges and opportunities for future research.
