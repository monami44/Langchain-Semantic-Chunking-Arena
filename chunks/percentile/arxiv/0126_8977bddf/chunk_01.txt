Although the use of active learning to increase learners engagement has recently been introduced in a variety of methods, empirical experiments are lacking. In this study, we attempted to align two experiments in order to 1 make a hypothesis for machine and 2 empirically confirm the effect of active learning on learning. In Experiment 1, we compared the effect of a passive form of learning to active form of learning.
