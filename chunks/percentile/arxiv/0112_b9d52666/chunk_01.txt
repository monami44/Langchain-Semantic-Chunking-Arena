Although machine learning is widely used in practice, little is known about practitioners understanding of potential security challenges. In this work, we close this substantial gap and contribute a qualitative study focusing on developers mental models of the machine learning pipeline and potentially vulnerable components. Similar studies have helped in other security fields to discover root causes or improve risk communication.
