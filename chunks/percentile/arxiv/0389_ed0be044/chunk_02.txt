This is due to many different machine learning frameworks, computer architectures, and machine learning models. Historically, for modelling and simulation on HPC systems such problems have been addressed through benchmarking computer applications, algorithms, and architectures. Extending such a benchmarking approach and identifying metrics for the application of machine learning methods to scientific datasets is a new challenge for both scientists and computer scientists. In this paper, we describe our approach to the development of scientific machine learning benchmarks and review other approaches to benchmarking scientific machine learning.
