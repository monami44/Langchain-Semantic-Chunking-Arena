Machine Learning algorithms apply mathematical equations to analyze datasets and predict values based on the dataset. In the field of cybersecurity, machine learning algorithms can be utilized to train and analyze the Intrusion Detection Systems IDSs on securityrelated datasets. In this paper, we tested different machine learning algorithms to analyze NSLKDD dataset using KNIME analytics.
