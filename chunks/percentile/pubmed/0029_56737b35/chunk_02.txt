BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the roles of cytokines and other laboratory parameters in determining the need for intensive care in COVID19 patients. METHODS This is a retrospective observational study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters of the patients were evaluated. Thirteen cytokines were measured along with baseline laboratory tests at admission and at 48hour intervals IL1β, IFNα, IFNβ, TNFα, MCP1, IL6, IL 8, IL10, IL2p70, IL17A, IL18, IL23, and IL33. RESULTS COVID19 was confirmed by PCR in 116 hospitalized patients. The mean age was 55.3 16.4 years. Seventyfour 63.8 of the patients were male and 42 36.2 were female. Twentytwo 18.9 patients 16 male, 6 female were transferred to the intensive care unit. A significant increase in white blood cell WBC, neutrophil Neu and lymphocyte Lym counts, NeuLym ratio NLR, lactate dehydrogenase LDH, INR international normalized ratio, activated prothrombin time aPTT, Ddimer DD, troponin Trop, ProBNP BNP, procalcitonin PCT, ferritin Fer, and alanine aminotransferase ALT values were observed in those requiring intensive care. A significant decrease was found in albumin Alb levels and Lym counts. Alb levels appeared to be protective against admission to intensive care. Except for IFN α, IL23, and IL33, the baseline values of other cytokines were above the threshold values. MCP1 and IL6 were higher in patients requiring intensive care. CONCLUSIONS High NLR and LDH and low Alb levels, especially with an increase in MCP1 and IL6, were found to be the best predictors of a serious COVID19 infection.
