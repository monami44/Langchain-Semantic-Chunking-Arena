BACKGROUND The causative agent of the coronavirus disease COVID19 is a virus from the SARSCoV2 group of viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome. The aim of the study was to examine the differences in hematological analyses of patients suffering from COVID19 with and without comorbidities, to determine the degree of the clinical picture based on the MEWS scale and to examine the persistence of inflammatory parameters with the severity of the clinical picture. METHODS The research is a crosssectional retrospective study, conducted in the laboratory diagnostics service of Tesanj General Hospital. It included 211 respondents positive for the coronavirus in the Tesanj General Hospital. The degree of severity of the clinical picture was determined on the basis of the MEWS scale. RESULTS A total of 211 patients positive for coronavirus participated in the study, of which 61.1 129 were male and 38.9 82 were female. Based on the results, a statistically significant difference was found in the ratio of hematological parameters in subjects with and without comorbidities p 0.05. A strong positive correlation was found between the ratio of SE and Ddimer in subjects and the degree of severity of the clinical picture. CONCLUSIONS A statistically significant difference was recorded in the ratio of hematological parameters lymphocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, hematocrit, and APTT in subjects with and without comorbidities in all three of the observed groups p 0.05, while there were no statistically significant differences in other hematological parameters p 0.05.
