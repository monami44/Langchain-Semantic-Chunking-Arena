Later, however, it has become increasingly difficult to further reduce their cost and environmental impact. Also, some packaging products continue to be made from nonrenewable materials and thus restrict growth of ecommerce. Further research is needed with a view to producing new packages from renewable sources such as cellulosecontaining materials, which are widely available in nature, or from recycled cellulosebased materials such as cartonboard. Improving distribution processes with new, more effective tools could additionally help alleviate the environmental impact of packaging. Similarly, new production processes such as additive manufacturing and 3D printing might help optimize package volume and shape, thereby facilitating more sustainable production through, for example, reduced CO2 emissions. Currently available technology can be useful to rethink the whole ecommerce packaging paradigm, which has changed very little over the past few decades.
