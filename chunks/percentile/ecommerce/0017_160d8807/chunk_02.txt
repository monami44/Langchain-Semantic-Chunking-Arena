Second, we should calculate the similarity between users. Third, we need to add this similarity to the weight factor of the improved slope one algorithm, and then, we get the final recommendation equation. We have carried out a number of experiments with the Amazon dataset, and the results prove that our recommender algorithm performs more accurately than the traditional slope one algorithm.
