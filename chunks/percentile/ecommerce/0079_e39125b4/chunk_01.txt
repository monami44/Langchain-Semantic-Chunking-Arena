In this paper, from the perspective of opinion dynamics theory, we investigate the interaction mechanism of a group of autonomous agents in an ecommerce community or social network, and the influence power of opinion leaders during the formation of group opinion. According to the opinions update manner and influence, this paper divides social agents within a social network into two subgroups opinion leaders and opinion followers. Then, we establish a new bounded confidencebased dynamic model for opinion leaders and followers to simulate the opinion evolution of the group of agents.
