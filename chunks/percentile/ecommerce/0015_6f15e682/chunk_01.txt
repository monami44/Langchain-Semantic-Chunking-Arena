The aim of this study is to investigate those factors that influence SMEs in developing countries in adopting ecommerce. This study is motivated by the fact that the adoption of ecommerce by SMEs, especially in developing countries, is still very far behind the adoption by large companies. Yet to be able to survive in the new economic era, which is the information era businesses, including SMEs, are forced to adopt ecommerce. Nonadopters will be left behind by the adopters. In addition, studies regarding ecommerce adoption by SMEs are rarely found.
