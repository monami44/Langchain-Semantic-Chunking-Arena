Therefore, the present article analyzes and synthesizes existing studies of mbanking adoption and maps the major theories that researchers have used to predict consumer intentions to adopt it. The findings indicate that the mbanking adoption literature is fragmented, though it commonly relies on the technology acceptance model and its modifications, revealing that compatibility with lifestyle and device, perceived usefulness, and attitude are the most significant drivers of intentions to adopt mbanking services in developed and developing countries. Moreover, the extant literature appears limited by its narrow focus on SMS banking in developing countries virtually no studies address the use of mbanking applications via smartphones or tablets or consider the consequences of such usage. This study makes several recommendations for continued research in the area of mobile banking.
