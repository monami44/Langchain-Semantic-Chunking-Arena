This study examines the impact of Internet and ecommerce adoption on bilateral trade flows using a panel of 21 developing and leastdeveloped countries and 30 OECD countries. Given the commitment of East African Community EAC to become the frontrunner in exportled economy across the African continent, special attention is dedicated to analyse the role of ICT and ecommerce on EACs export performance. The empirical results indicate that better access to the modern ICT and adoption of ecommerce applications stimulate bilateral trade flows at various levels.
