The methodology adopted is a review of previous studies done on each individual dimension of sustainability, since no joint studies have been carried out and integrated into the same literature framework. Furthermore, a case study involving companies in Kenya and Jordan is used in order to collect empirical data. The findings of the study show that First, integration is essential for the sustainability of ecommerce in its three dimensions second, tradeoffs must be taken in the various dimensions in order for companies to realize sustainable ecommerce. This will go in hand with the realization of the maximum benefits of integrating the three dimensions in ecommerce to make it more sustainable. In conclusion, by applying these aspects of sustainability in ecommerce, it is clear that everyone wins. This is achieved by improving and safeguarding the quality of life by protecting the environment, preserving natural resources, and maintaining and sustaining the economy. The implications of the study are that, in order to make ecommerce more sustainable, to make decisions and take action, socialenvironmentaleconomic aspects must be considered as a fundamental element, and must be treated as a group and not separately as in previous studies. In this way, we can realize greater benefits, not only in online business sustainability, but also in policymaking and environmental protection, while companies will create economic value as well as avoiding labor unrest.
