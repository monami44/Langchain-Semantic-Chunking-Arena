Next, the framework was empirically tested using a sample of 340 exporters. The evidence shows that specialized ecommerce marketing capabilities directly increase a firms degree of distribution and communication efficiency, which in turn leads to enhanced export venture market performance. Overall, the analyses provide support for the need to incorporate ecommerce constructs into existing RBV theory in export marketing. Theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed and directions for future research are offered.
