The COVID19 pandemic has disrupted retail and accelerated the trend towards electronic commerce. This study explores the reasons for and the implications of this shift. Our study builds on the consumer behavior literature, emerging COVID19 research, and the environmentally imposed constraints perspective to describe how online purchasing behavior evolved during the COVID19 crisis. The objective is to better understand how consumers use ecommerce to react to, cope with and adapt to periods of environmentally imposed constraints.
