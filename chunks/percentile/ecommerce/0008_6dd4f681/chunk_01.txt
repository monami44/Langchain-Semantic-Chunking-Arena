The rise of the internet is often associated with the death of distance or at least the decreasing relevance of geographical distance in the supply of information. We investigate whether distance still matters for online trade in physical goods. We use data from an online consumer survey panel on online crossborder trade in goods in a linguistically fragmented EU market. The analysis confirms that distancerelated trade costs are greatly reduced compared to offline trade in the same goods.
