It has, in other words, distinctive advantages as a normative concept for describing what is wrong with attempts to undermine democracy. 3 TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING Three desiderata may be derived from the above discussion. A general theoretical account of democratic backsliding must explain why particular developments constitute a degeneration of democracy rather than simply stating that they are a degeneration of democracy, which presupposes that it can identify democratic regressions without resorting to a Eurocentric developmental view of history, while resisting the temptation to overgeneralize the place and function of particular idealtypical features of democracy as models of democracyapproaches usually do. I suggest that the tradition of critical theory can provide useful theoretical resources for constructing an account of democratic backsliding that meets these demands. Both democracy and regression are themes that figure prominently in that tradition, and critical theorists have been exceptionally sensitive to the problems that plague teleological conceptions of history e.g., Allen, 2016 Habermas, 1992 Horkheimer Adorno, 1969, pp. 234237 Jaeggi, 2018 Verov≈°ek, 2019.
