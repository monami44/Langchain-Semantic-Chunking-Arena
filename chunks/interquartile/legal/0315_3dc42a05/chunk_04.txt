This not only has discomforting imperialist overtones. Insofar as it universalizes what might be a specifically Western understanding of democracy, it also jars with the articles ambition to offer a general account of democratic backsliding. For these reasons, a satisfactory account of democratic backsliding would do better not to rely on a Eurocentric developmental view of history. It may be asked why we should bother dealing with vexing issues of regression or progress if we could give up the concept of democratic backsliding instead. The narrower concepts used in some of the empirical and legal literature, such as coup détat or executive aggrandizement, come with much less philosophical baggage to navigate. Arent these ultimately better alternatives? While there is nothing wrong with using these concepts to categorize the different kinds of things that may occur when democracies are under attack, it would be rash to dispense with the notion of democratic backsliding altogether. As a term that describes a regressive development in English, backsliding is indeed a synonym for regression, it captures more accurately than alternative concepts what poses the problem in the first place that coups détat or acts of executive aggrandizement are usually threatening or undoing hardfought political achievements concerning individual or collective freedoms cf.
