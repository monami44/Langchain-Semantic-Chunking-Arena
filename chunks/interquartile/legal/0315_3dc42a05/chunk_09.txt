In recent critical theory, the question of how a broadly applicable, nonEurocentric understanding of progress might look like has been usefully approached by framing progress in nonteleological, formal, and negativistic terms Allen, 2016 Jaeggi, 2018 Verov≈°ek, 2019. Progress, it has been suggested, is imaginable without assuming that progressive developments have a particular final goal a rejection of teleology, nor need a generalized notion of progress stipulate any particular substantive outcomes that dynamics of sociopolitical change need to generate in order to count as progressive a formal, rather than substantive, view.
