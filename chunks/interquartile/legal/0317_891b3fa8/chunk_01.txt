Contested multilateralism describes the situation that results from the pursuit of strategies by states, multilateral organizations, and nonstate actors to use multilateral institutions, existing or newly created, to challenge the rules, practices, or missions of existing multilateral institutions. It occurs when coalitions dissatisfied with existing institutions combine threats of exit, voice, and the creation of alternative institutions to pursue policies and practices different from those of existing institutions. Contested multilateralism takes two principal forms regime shifting and competitive regime creation. It can be observed across issue areas.
