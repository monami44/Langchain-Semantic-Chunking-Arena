In partial defence, the ICs extensive interpretation and even law making is arguably foreseen by states when they choose the treaty format. Changes to treaties usually require unanimity,85 though states could instead agree to allow some changes by qualified majority voting,86 or establish a separate treaty body for interpretation. And the IC is often authorized to follow rules of treaty interpretation agreed by the states, including such guides as the object and purpose of the treaty.87 States are also often unable and unwilling to specify treaties fully, instead agreeing to deliberately incomplete contracts88 to reduce their own decisionmaking costs. They leave it to the IC to clarify the existing provisions,89 expecting indeed that decisions through the conventions mechanism will create a significant new body of international law.90 The independence of ICs may arguably reduce the impact of differential state power in this lawmaking process.91 Both when adjudicating disputes and when developing the treaty, the IC must heed the principle of audi alteram partemto hear the strongest arguments on behalf of all parties. This concern supports broad representation on the international bench of different legal systems and geographical regionsand arguably of genders and other relevant segments of the affected populations.92 Such representation may also show that the IC treats the parties to the dispute as equals.93 ICs secure such local knowledge while maintaining impartiality in different ways. The ECtHR always includes the judge nominated by the accused state on the bench, while the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights excludes such judges. Strong professional commitments to ruleoflaw standards reduce the risk of domination and give evidence that the judges exercise their discretion appropriately.
