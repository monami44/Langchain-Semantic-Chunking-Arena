There was learning from other countries, but this was mostly at the level of health experts, exchanging data, models, and health measures, even if expert discussion e.g., on how useful which masks are has also limited learning from others.

Dynamic learning by doing seems to be relevant, but it needs functioning and fast feedback and accountability mechanisms, quick matching responses, and corrective decisions and actions. One of the socalled solutions, that is, closing borders, resulted in many problems and was implemented inconsistently with exceptions for commuters.
