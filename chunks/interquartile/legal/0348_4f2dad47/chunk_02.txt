I argue that the link should not be seen as mechanical or procedural. Weaknesses so obviously apparent in the enforcement process signify the lack of vigor in the normative consensus the vim and vigor by which the face was adorned by highflying colors might in fact have masked a frail body.2 This pattern of inconsistency is visible across a wide range of issue areas, from womens rights to economic justice, and in diverse political contexts, from Iran to the United States. Examining the disjuncture between oftencelebrated international human rights judicial instruments and their oftenlamented enforcement and cooperation failures can give scholars and practitioners alike a clear view of the tensions that Afshari describes.
