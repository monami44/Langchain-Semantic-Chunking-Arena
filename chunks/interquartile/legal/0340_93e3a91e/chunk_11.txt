Poly 293 2010.59 As Edwards notes, the provisions of the Habitats Directive are implemented in the context of European treaty law. Article 1912 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU TFEU premises EU environmental policy on the need to provide a high level of protection for the environment, based in part on the precautionary principle and preventive action. These prescriptions, Edwards argues, ought to be binding on domestic courts, in which case they might facilitate substantive review. Although Article 1912 probably does not have direct effect, it is a prescriptive provision of the TFEU and, as such, is binding on domestic courts. This follows from Article 43 of the Treaty on European Union TEU ex Article 10 of the EC Treaty. Further, the new provision in Article 191 of the TEU, requiring Member States to provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law, arguably bolsters the established case under Article 43 TEU concerning the duties of domestic courts to ensure the full effectiveness of EU law even where EU law rules do not have direct effect citations omitted.
