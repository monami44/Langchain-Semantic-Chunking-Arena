The proposal for Regulation 20171939 establishing the European Public Prosecutors Office The EPPO Regulation was criticized for completely excluding the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU from judicial review of decisions on forum of prosecution by the EPPO, an EU body. The system of judicial review under the EPPO Regulation has improved significantly relative to its initial proposal, by enabling national courts to refer preliminary questions to the CJEU.
