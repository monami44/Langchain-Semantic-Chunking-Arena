The only existing model that estimates the risk of unfavorable future quality of life shows important differences from risk models for death, particularly the relative importance of current measures of quality of life.32 More astute anticipation of an unfavorable quality of life until death, in addition to anticipation of death, would better identify patients for whom detailed discussions of prognosis and options are appropriate. In choosing among options, this information gap regarding nonmortality patientcentered outcomes is exacerbated by the lack of rigor in collecting health status information in major trials, although this is improving. Even less is known about the relative impact of the disease and therapies on caregiver burden and quality of life for family members.4346Download figureDownload PowerPointFigure 2.
