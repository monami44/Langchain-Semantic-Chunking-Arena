The first question addresses conceptual and methodological issues. While most authors agree that Europeanization is a process and not an outcome variable Exadaktylos and Radaelli 2012a, they disagree on how to define Europeanization and on how to study the impact of this process at the domestic level. In this Debate, and in line with the bulk of Swiss literature, we focus primarily on the Europeanization of policymaking and related outputs. This means that we give priority to these dimensions, but contributors were invited to address politics and polity impacts under question 4 below. Authors first presented how they have defined their dependent variable, and how they have measured the EUinduced effects.
