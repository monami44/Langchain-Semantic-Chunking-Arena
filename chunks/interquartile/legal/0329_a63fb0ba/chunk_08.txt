Of course, we do not claim that it will provide a definitive answer to concerns raised by MPs. Nevertheless, it offers a systematic overview of findings from empirical studies assessing Europeanization impacts on Swiss policies during the last decades. At the time of writing, Swiss empirical research on Europeanization has essentially focused on the 1990s and 2000s. Unfortunately, the inherent timelag proper to data collection, analysis and publication processes renders difficult the assessment of how relatively recent events, such as the financial or the Eurozone crises, affected the Europeanization of Swiss policymaking. In other words, on the basis of current empirical research it is too early to tell if, and to what extent, trends have changed during these last particularly turbulent years. Despite these limitations, the existing scholarship is able to provide a good picture of how Europeanization has varied at different critical moments of SwissEU relations. While Europeanization exerts its influence beyond the EU Lavenex and Schimmelfennig 2009 and even beyond Europe Schimmelfennig 2007 it is especially relevant for a country like Switzerland that is located in the middle of the continent and that is strongly dependent on its economic relationships with the EU. During the last five decades, Switzerland has followed the socalled third way between full EU membership and isolation, i.e. a way aiming to maximize the economic gains associated with access to the European market while minimizing the related political costs. To that end, Switzerland has relied on a twofold strategy. On the one hand, it has negotiated agreements with the EU on a bilateral basis. This is the socalled direct form of Europeanization.
