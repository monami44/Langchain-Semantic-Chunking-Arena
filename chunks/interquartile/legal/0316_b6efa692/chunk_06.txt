It is the ICs performance of its tasks that renders it a legitimate authority. The core task for ICs is to adjudicate disputes by issuing judgments on the basis of legal sources and legal methodsrather than, for example, resolving disputes by diplomatic bargains or threats. They should be loyal to their mandate and follow agreed legal standards of treaty interpretation and legal reasoning to arrive at impartial judgmentsand must be seen to do so.68 This task requires that the IC is sufficiently independent of the parties to the disputes, and that the judges are seen to be impartial in the particular case.69 The requisite independence and impartiality vary among issue areas, for example handling interstate disputes or individuals human rights complaints. Important mechanisms include the procedures to nominate, assess and elect the judges. For instance, judges of permanent ICs appear more independent than ad hoc arbitration panels.70 And judges tend to act more independently if they cannot be reappointed. The judges of the ECtHR now serve one nineyear term, nonrenewable precisely to reinforce independence and impartiality.71 In order to settle disputes impartially and by legal methods, ICs must be independent of the parties to the disputes, and enjoy wide discretion to interpret treaties and make international law. The combination fuels fears of the rule not of law, but of judges, who enjoy too much latitude, with too few safeguards, for discretionary decisionmaking.72 Further risks arise from the often opaque roles of many unseen actors who nominate judges and help administer and advise cases.73 Domination by IC judges may be on their own behalf or as an instrument of powerful states, multinationals or investors.74 ICs independence must be bounded or constrained to ensure that judges develop the treaty and decide impartially by sound legal method, and are seen to do so, giving states reason to defer to ICs as better positioned than themselves.75 ICs must be sufficiently independent from the states whose disputes they adjudicate, so some checks and mechanisms familiar from domestic constitutional design are ill suited.76 Multilevel legal, structural, political and discursive accountability mechanisms are available, such as appointment procedures, budget control, state parties statements,77 and professional norms and standards of interpretation.78 The election procedures illustrate the range of challenges and responses.79 Council of Europe bodies vet and select one judge for the ECtHR on behalf of each state, from a slate of three the state nominates, including both main genders.80 ITLOS judges must represent the principal legal systems of the world and geographical diversity.81 The oneoff international investment arbitration panels consist of one arbitrator selected by the investor, one by the state, and a third selected by those two or by the parties.82 This accountability arrangement attracts growing criticism, due partly to the de facto precedential effects of judgments far beyond the parties to the dispute, and concerns about their internal consistency and coherence with other parts of international law.83 Their core task of adjudicating disputes and interpreting treaties by legal methods requires ICs to rely on legal sources and methods, and comply with various ruleoflaw standards.84 This ensures the legal mode of settling disputes, and reduces risks of arbitrary rulings. A frequent criticism is that ICs deviate from standards of legal reasoning and rule of law when they interpret treatiesoften far beyond what states originally consented to.
