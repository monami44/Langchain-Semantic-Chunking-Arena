The acute and chronic lead intoxication seen in Flint, MI, USA, where inadequate monitoring and abatement of lead in the water supply resulted in lead toxicity in more than 27 000 children, was a prime example of such costly pollutionrelated disease.2 The contamination of Flints water placed these children at risk for neurological injury, severe behaviour problems, reading disabilities, and decreased educational attainment.

That this quote is a timely reminder of the value of clean air is clearly highlighted by recent estimates from The Lancet Commission on pollution and health that reported 9 million premature deaths from pollution in 2015, 42 million deaths from ambient air pollution, and 29 million deaths from household air pollution. Lowincome and middleincome countries are particularly affected, with the poor and most vulnerable at the greatest risk.
