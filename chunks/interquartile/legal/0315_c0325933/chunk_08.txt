But while I am not unsympathetic to this approach, for our purposes it seems needlessly restrictive. If, as I suggested, the internal logic of democratic constitutionalism that Habermas reconstructs in his system of rights travels beyond the West without being a mere topdown imposition with imperial intent, perhaps we need not limit our analysis of democratic regressions to our own order. A more fruitful direction is to modify ones conception of progress.
