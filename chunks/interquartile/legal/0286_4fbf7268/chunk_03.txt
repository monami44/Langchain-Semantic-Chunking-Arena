The main functions of the body of constitutional jurisdiction are distinguished into quasijudicial, cognitive and evaluative, harmonizing. The consistent universal approach of the European Court of Human Rights hereinafter referred to as ECHR states that the notion of court does not necessarily mean classical jurisdiction, integrated into the judicial system of the state. Finally, the article proves the requirement of recognizing the CC as a court established by law essentially and functionally. Consistent approaches and criteria for defining the notion of court established by law formulated by the UN Committee on Human Rights and the ECHRs caselaw prove that the CC can be identified as the last mandatory domestic remedy before applying to international judicial institutions, subject to the criterion of an effective remedy, formulated by the ECHRs caselaw during proceedings in the CC.
