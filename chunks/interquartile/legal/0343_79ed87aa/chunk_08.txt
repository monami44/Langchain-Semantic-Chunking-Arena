Although individual medical decisions taken collectively have implications for distributive justice and resource allocation, it is not the responsibility of clinicians, patients, or families to directly factor these global considerations into individual decisions.14 Rather, discussions regarding alternative treatment options, including no treatment, should be focused on meeting a specific individuals values, goals, and preferences within the context of societal rules and regulations.Why Advanced Heart Failure?Heart failure affects 2.4 of the adult population and over 11 of the expanding population 80 years old.15 Estimated total heart failure costs in the United States are projected to reach 44.6 billion by 2015.15 Existing therapies slow, but infrequently reverse, disease progression. As a result, the prevalence of symptomatic heart failure has increased, including a prolongation of the advanced phase of the disease.16 The American Heart Association characterizes the far end of the heart failure continuum as stage D, or refractory endstage heart failure,17 further defined by others,18,19 including the European Society of Cardiology Table 2.20 These overlapping definitions describe a group of patients for whom symptoms limit daily life despite usual recommended therapies and for whom lasting remission into less symptomatic disease is unlikely. The increasing prevalence, high symptom burden, and possible diseaseexchanging therapies ie, transplantation and mechanical circulatory support for patients living with advanced heart failure mandate a systematic and thoughtful approach to decision making.Table 2.
