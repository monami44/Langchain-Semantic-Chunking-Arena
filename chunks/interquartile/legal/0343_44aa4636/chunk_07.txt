It asks that clinicians and patients share information with each other and work toward patientcentered decisions about treatment.9 Shared decision making incorporates the perspective of the patient, who is responsible for articulating goals, values, and preferences as they relate to his or her health care. Shared decision making incorporates the perspective of the clinician, who is responsible for narrowing the diagnostic and treatment options to those that are medically reasonable. Shared decision making is most easily applied to preferencesensitive decisions, in which both clinicians and patients agree that equipoise exists, and decision support helps patients think through, forecast, and deliberate their options. However, in situations in which clinicians hold the view that scientific evidence for benefit strongly outweighs harm, behavioral support eg, smoking cessation counseling designed to describe, justify, and recommend specific behavior may also be appropriate and complementary to decision support.10 Finally, certain therapeutic options may be considered unreasonable and therefore independent of patient demands, although situations of medical futility are relatively rare.6 Although not all patients will be able to clearly articulate decisions that are congruent with their stated goals, shared decision making aims to ensure that patients values, goals, and preferences are explored and incorporated into the medical decisionmaking process.Patientcentered medicine has been suggested as the next phase in health care.11 Shared decision making puts into practice the principle of patientcentered care, which the Institute of Medicine has identified as 1 of the 6 pillars of quality,12 with patientcentered care defined as providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.12 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act devotes 4 pages to patientcentered care, specifically calling for the development of decision aids, shared decisionmaking programs, and metrics for the quality of decision making.13It will be assumed throughout this document that discussions and decision making with patients also include, when appropriate, the family and other individuals involved, such as caregivers and companions. The approach to decision making outlined in this Scientific Statement takes the perspective of the individual patient rather than that of society in general.
