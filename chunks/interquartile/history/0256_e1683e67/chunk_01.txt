This article traces the deep cultural and experiential foundations that animated Christian Democratic Europeanism between the mid1940s and the birth of the European Economic Community in the late 1950s. It shows how the language of Europeanness, generated in a period of multiple and intense crisis, congealed around symbolisms of Christianity and spirituality. More specifically, it connects the postSecond World War Christian Democratic vision of Europe to the 1920s GermanCatholic articulation of the Abendland the Christian West, understood as a supranational and symbolic space alternative to the Soviet Union and the United States and imbued with antimaterialist, antisocialist and antiliberal principles. The argument here is that, in mutated form and in context of the Cold War, this view sustained the political reconstruction of Western Europe after the horrors of the Second World War, the European thought and language of Christian Democracy and the commitment to the project of European integration.
