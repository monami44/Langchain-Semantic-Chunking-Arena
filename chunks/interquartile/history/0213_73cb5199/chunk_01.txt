The killings during the Second World War WWII, with nearly 100,000 victims, is one of the greatest losses of life in Slovenias modern history and most of the victims are still buried in hidden mass graves and remain unidentified. Identity, ancestry, and phenotypic SNPs, as well as STR markers are already used for solving various cases with Next Generation Sequencing NGS technology. In this study, the Precision ID GlobalFiler NGS STR panel was used to identify the WWII victim that could not be identified with capillary electrophoresis CE analyses because limited statistical support was obtained after amplification of autosomal STRs using CE STR kits. Bones and teeth were analysed and compared to family references nephew and niece on paternal line.
