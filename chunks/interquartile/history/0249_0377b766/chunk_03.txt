bMain outcome measureb Adults admitted to hospital for psychiatric disorders recorded between 1971 and 2011 in the Finnish hospital discharge register. bMethodsb We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between evacuation to temporary foster care in Sweden during the second world war and admission to hospital for a psychiatric disorder between ages 38 and 78 years. Fixed effects methods were employed to control for all unobserved social and genetic characteristics shared among siblings. bResultsb Among men and women combined, the risk of admission to hospital for a psychiatric disorder did not differ between Finnish adults evacuated to Swedish foster families and their nonevacuated siblings hazard ratio 0.89, 95 confidence interval 0.64 to 1.26. Evidence suggested a lower risk of admission for any mental disorder 0.67, 0.44 to 1.03 among evacuated men, whereas for women there was no association between evacuation and the overall risk of admission for a psychiatric disorder 1.21, 0.80 to 1.83. When admissions for individual psychiatric disorders were analyzed, evacuated girls were significantly more likely than their nonevacuated sisters to be admitted to hospital for a mood disorder as an adult 2.19, 1.10 to 4.33. bConclusionsb The Finnish evacuation policy was not associated with an increased overall risk of admission to hospital for a psychiatric disorder in adulthood among former evacuees. In fact, evacuation was associated with a marginally reduced risk of admission for any psychiatric disorder among men. Among women who had been evacuated, however, the risk of being admitted to hospital for a mood disorder was increased.
