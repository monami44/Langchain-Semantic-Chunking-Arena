Nine of 10 samples were profiled using autosomal STR loci, which resulted in useful DNA profiles for 9 skeletal remains. A comparison of established victims profiles against a reference sample database yielded 6 positive identifications.ConclusionDNA analysis may efficiently contribute to the identification of remains even seven decades after the end of the World War II. The significant percentage of positively identified remains 60, even when the number of the examined possible living relatives was relatively small only 12, proved the importance of cooperation with the members of the local community, who helped to identify the closest missing persons relatives and collect referent samples from them.
