By the end of the Second World War, many of the Polish citiesand especially their historic centreswere in ruins. This was caused by both bombings and sieges conducted by the Nazis and Soviets. The particular group of cities is associated with former German landsnow called the Recovered Territorieswhich were incorporated into the borders of Poland as compensation for its Eastern Borderlands lost to the Soviet Union. These cities started to be gradually rebuilt after the end of the war, although one can distinguish certain stages and types of interventions, varying from the restoration and idealisation of the prewar townscapes socalled Polish School of Conservation, which was developed along principles contradictory to the urban conservation theories of these times to late modern as well as postmodern called the retroversion principles. This process is ongoing, meaning the reconstruction of the historic cities is not yet completed.
