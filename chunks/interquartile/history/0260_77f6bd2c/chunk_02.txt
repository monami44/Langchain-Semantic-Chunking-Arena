DNA was isolated from bone and teeth samples using an optimized phenolchloroform DNA extraction procedure. All samples required a preextraction decalcification with EDTA and additional postextraction DNA purification using filter columns. Additionally, DNA from 12 reference samples buccal swabs from potential living relatives was extracted using the Qiagen DNA extraction method. QuantifilerTM Human DNA Quantification Kit was used for DNA quantification. PowerPlex ESI kit was used to simultaneously amplify 15 autosomal short tandem repeat STR loci, and PowerPlex Y23 was used to amplify 23 Y chromosomal STR loci. Matching probabilities were estimated using a standard statistical approach.ResultsA total of 10 samples were processed, 9 teeth and 1 femoral fragment.
