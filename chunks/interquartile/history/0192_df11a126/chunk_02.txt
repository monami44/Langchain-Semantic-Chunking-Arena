We extracted 0.8 to 100 ng DNAg of bone powder from 82 bones. Autosomal genetic profiles and Ychromosome haplotypes were obtained from 98 of the bones, and mitochondrial DNA mtDNA haplotypes from 95 of the bones for the HVI region and from 98 of the bones for the HVII region. Genetic profiles of the nuclear and mtDNA were determined for reference persons. For traceability in the event of contamination, we created an elimination database including genetic profiles of the nuclear and mtDNA of all persons that had been in contact with the skeletal remains. When comparing genetic profiles, we matched 28 of the 84 bones analyzed with living relatives brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, nephews, or cousins. The statistical analyses showed a high confidence of correct identification for all 28 victims in the Konfin I mass grave posterior probability ranged from 99.9 to more than 99.999999.
