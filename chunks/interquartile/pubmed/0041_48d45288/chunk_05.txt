SARSCoV2 nucleocapsid N protein is a structural component of the virus with essential roles in the replication and packaging of the viral RNA genome. The N protein is also an important target of COVID19 antigen tests and a promising vaccine candidate along with the spike protein. Here, we report a compact stemloop DNA aptamer that binds tightly to the Nterminal RNAbinding domain of SARSCoV2 N protein. Crystallographic analysis shows that a hexanucleotide DNA motif 5TCGGAT3 of the aptamer fits into a positively charged concave surface of NNTD and engages essential RNAbinding residues including Tyr109, which mediates a sequencespecific interaction in a uracilbinding pocket. Avid binding of the DNA aptamer allows isolation and sensitive detection of fulllength N protein from crude cell lysates, demonstrating its selectivity and utility in biochemical applications. We further designed a chemically modified DNA aptamer and used it as a probe to examine the interaction of NNTD with various RNA motifs, which revealed a strong preference for uridinerich sequences. Our studies provide a highaffinity chemical probe for the SARSCoV2 N protein RNAbinding domain, which may be useful for diagnostic applications and investigating novel antiviral agents.
