Therefore, we investigated our samples motivations, in particular, because this was unpaid research. We used computerassisted tools to synthesize openended answers to How did you hear about this project and What is your interest in this study? To understand what led people to participate, we found participants interests were vaccine effects and womenspeoples health, personal experience related to the vaccine, and a love for science and data. We compared responses among demographic subgroups to avoid an overfocus on the majority responses e.g., cisgender women or White people, and we found our themes reflected multiple types of altruism. These results were important in showing how research that is responsive to public needs encourages high responses from both marginalized and majority communities. We utilized inclusivity and familiarity to build credibility and create online presences to engender trust with the public. Future clinical research can be informed by our findings. We show strategies for doing ethical clinical research by speaking to people from all groups who may be affected. DOI 10.117717455057241285189 PMID 39382478 Indexed for MEDLINE
