This study assessed the impact of distancing measures during the COVID19 pandemic on cancer diagnostic activities, including gastrointestinal endoscopy GIE. It analyzed GIE volumes from 2020 to 2022 in comparison to 20182019, considering variations in resilience linked to socioeconomic status SES. The analysis utilized data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Services database, covering the entire population and medical facilities. Diagnostic GIE rates 20182022 in Gwangju Metropolitan City and Jeonnam province were examined, comparing agestandardized rates ASRs by area, gender, and SES. The results indicated a decline in ASRs for colonoscopy and endoscopic gastroduodenoscopy EGD in 2020 compared to 20182019, followed by an increase in 20212022, except for EGD in the medical aid population. SES based and ruralurban disparities were evident in the recovery of GIE rates. The findings suggest that equityfocused strategies are needed to ensure equitable healthcare access among different socioeconomic groups after pandemic. Chonnam Medical Journal, 2024.
