The ease of expression and engineering of single domain antibodies, known as nanobodies, make them attractive alternatives to conventional antibodies in pointofcare diagnostics such as lateral flow assays. In lateral flow assays, gold nanoparticle bioconjugates serve as labels which display affinity molecules on the gold surface. While examples of nanobody gold nanoparticle bioconjugates exist, few utilise the simple onestep approach of physisorption owing to undesirable nanoparticle aggregation and loss of functionality. Here we show that engineering nanobodies into multivalent structures can significantly enhance their functionality when physisorbed onto gold nanoparticles. This approach enables resulting bioconjugates to withstand multiple processing steps required for longterm nanoparticle storage within lateral flow assays. Specifically, we show that the trivalent version of VHHV nanobody VHH3 against the S1 protein of SARSCoV2 can be immobilised onto gold nanoparticles through passive adsorption. Unlike its monovalent and bivalent nanobody counterparts, using VHHV3 preserves nanoparticle stability under salt stress, blocking, washing, and freezedrying conditions while maintaining picomolar sensitivity to the S1 protein. We anticipate that this facile strategy is a significant advancement towards the integration of nanobodies in lateral flow assay development. DOI 10.1039d4nr02762k PMID 39382227
