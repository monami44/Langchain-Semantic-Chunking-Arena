39.7 increased. In the 7 to 15 years group, bicycle riding injuries 50.9 vs. 65.6 and personal mobility device injuries 2.4 vs. 4.6 increased. The 1 to 6 years group also showed an increase in bicycle accident injuries 15.8 vs. 22.4. In the 1 year group, injuries from falls increased 44.5 vs. 49.9. Selfharm injuries in the 7 to 15 years group also increased 1.6 vs. 2.8. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID19 pandemic period, the overall number of pediatric injuries decreased, while injuries occurring at home and during indoor activities increased. Traffic accidents involving bicycles and personal mobility devices and selfharm injuries increased in the 7 to 15 years group. In the 1 year group, the incidence of falls increased. Medical and societal preparedness is needed so that we might anticipate these changes in the patterns of pediatric injuries during future infectious disease pandemics. 2023 The Korean Society of Traumatology.
