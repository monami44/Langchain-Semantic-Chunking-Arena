OBJECTIVE When hyperinfectious diseases sweep over the world, procommunity participation has been found to effectively curb the spread of viruses. This study explores the associations among mediarelated perceptions and media users procommunity participation during the peak of the 2022 COVID19 outbreaks in China. METHODS A crosssectional survey was conducted among 976 Chinese media users in April 2022 to collect data on their procommunity participation and perceptions of pandemic news influence, information relevance, and credibility of traditional media and social media. Hierarchical regression analyses were run to analyze the associations between these perceptual variables and procommunity participation. RESULTS The findings revealed that information relevance was positively associated with perceived news influence on oneself and procommunity participation. Perceived credibility of traditional media was positively associated with perceived news influence on both oneself and others. Perceived credibility of social media was positively associated with perceived news influence on others. Additionally, perceived credibility of traditional media positively moderated the association between information relevance and perceived news influence on others. CONCLUSIONS Information relevance and perceived media credibility play significant roles in shaping media user perceptions of news influence and their subsequent procommunity behaviors. Higher perceived media credibility can produce a broader impact on perceived news influence on both media users themselves and others, highlighting its importance in public health communication strategies. These insights can inform media practices and public health policies to enhance community participation during public health crises. The Authors 2024.
