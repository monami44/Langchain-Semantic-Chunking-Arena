COVID19 can lead to pulmonary complications, including organizing pneumonia. Steroids are essential in treating postCOVID19 organizing pneumonia. However, research on the clinical benefits of initiating steroid treatment early for this condition is limited. To investigate the steroid initiation time in its association with treatment duration and corticosteroid dose for treating postCOVID19 organizing pneumonia, we analyzed the data of 91 patients with postCOVID19 organizing pneumonia at Chonnam National University Hospital between October 2020 and December 2022. Patients were categorized into early and late groups based on time from COVID19 diagnosis to steroid initiation time for organizing pneumonia. The mean time interval between COVID19 infection and steroid initiation time for treating organizing pneumonia, was 18.48.6 days. Within the early treatment group treatment initiated 18.4 days after COVID19, which included 55 patients, the mean duration of steroid treatment was 43.118.3days. In contrast, the late treatment group initiated 18.4 days after COVID19, which consisted of 36 patients, had a longer mean duration of steroid treatment 59.122.6 days p0.01. Regarding corticosteroid dosing, the early treatment group had an average dosage of 0.50.3 mgkgday, in contrast to the late group, which averaged 0.80.3 mgkgday p0.01. Regression analysis showed steroid initiation time significantly influenced treatment duration β0.80 , p0.01 and dosage β0.03, p0.01. The clinical benefits of early steroid treatment for postCOVID19 organizing pneumonia may lie in its association with reduced steroid treatment duration and dosage. Chonnam Medical Journal, 2024.
