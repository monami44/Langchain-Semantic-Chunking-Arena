BACKGROUND We created a survey to assess menstrual side effects after COVID19 vaccination when we noticed news stories that denied or discounted the experiences of tens of thousands of menstruating and formerly menstruating people who reported experiencing bleeding changes. This survey had an unprecedented response hundreds of times higher than we had anticipated n 101,824.
