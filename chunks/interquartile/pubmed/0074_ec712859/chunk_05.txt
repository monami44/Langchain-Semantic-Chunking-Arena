OBJECTIVES We investigated what motivated our sample to participate without remuneration to understand both general motivations for survey participation as well as why this survey captured the interest of so many. DESIGN We used openended responses from our online, mixedmethod survey collected from April to October 2021. METHODS Using computerassisted qualitative data analysis tools in R, we conducted a thematic analysis on openended responses. We used topic modeling to cluster the data, synthesize responses across 22,737 participants, and inform the themes summarizing the responses to What is your interest in this project? We compared and contrasted responses across groups racial identity, ethnicity, gender to examine whether the themes were representative across the demographic groups in our study. RESULTS The themes that characterized participants interest in participating were vaccine effects and womenspeoples health, personal experience related to the vaccine, and a love for science and data. We compared responses among demographic subgroups to avoid an overfocus on majority group responses and found the themes were reflected across each group. Lastly, we found our themes reflected multiple types of altruism. CONCLUSION These results were important in showing how emergent research that focuses on the concerns of potential participants can encourage high response rates from both marginalized and majority communities.
