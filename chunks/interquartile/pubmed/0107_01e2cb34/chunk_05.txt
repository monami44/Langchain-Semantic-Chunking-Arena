Samples from both groups were collected on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 after plasma infusion. We measured the expression level of TLR78, IRF37, CTLA4, PD1 and T cell transcription factors by Realtime PCR in the mentioned groups. Thirteen cytokines were also evaluated using flow cytometry method. Results showed that compared to the normal control plasma group, the expression levels of TLR7, 8, IRF3, 7 and PD1 and CTLA4, on days 3, 5 and 7 after convalescent plasma infusion, were significantly decreased. On the other hand, Gene expression results showed that the expression levels of Tbet, RORγ3 and Foxp3 on days 3, 5 and 7 after convalescent plasma infusion were significantly increased compared to the normal control plasma group. After convalescent plasma infusion, the viral load was significantly decreased compared to the normal control plasma group. Convalescent plasma infusion also reduced the plasma cytokines levels, including IL6, IL10, and IL4, and enhanced the level of IL2, IFN γ and perforin comparing the normal control plasma group. According to the results, the convalescent plasma infusion led to a decrease in the expression of innate immunity receptors and an increase in the expression of transcription factors of adaptive immunity. Therefore, it may be concluded that convalescent plasma infusion can modulate the immune response. To achieve a reliable consequence, further studies are required.
