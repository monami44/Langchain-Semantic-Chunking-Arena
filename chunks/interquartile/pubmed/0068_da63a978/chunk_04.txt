SARSCoV2 virus infects cells by engaging with ACE2 requiring protease TMPRSS2. ACE2 is highly expressed in kidneys. Predictors for severe disease are high age and male sex. We hypothesized that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins are more abundant 1 in males and with increasing age in kidney and 2 in urine and extracellular vesicles EVs from male patients with COVID19 and 3 SARSCoV2 is present in urine and EVs during infection. Kidney cortex samples from patients subjected to cancer nephrectomy malefemale 50 years75 years, n 24 80 years, n 15 were analyzed for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels. Urine from patients hospitalized with SARSCoV2 infection was analyzed for ACE2 and TMPRSS2. uEVs were used for immunoblotting and SARSCoV2 mRNA and antigen detection. Tissue ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels did not change with age. ACE2 was not more abundant in male kidneys in any age group. ACE2 protein was associated with proximal tubule apical membranes in cortex. TMPRSS2 was observed predominantly in the medulla. ACE2 was elevated significantly in uEVs and urine from patients with COVID19 with no sex difference compared with urine from controls wwo albuminuria. TMPRSS2 was elevated in uEVs from males compared to female. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 did not colocalize in uEVsapical membranes. SARSCoV2 nucleoprotein and mRNA were not detected in urine. Higher kidney ACE2 protein abundance is unlikely to explain higher susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection in males. Kidney tubular cells appear not highly susceptible to SARSCoV2 infection. Loss of ACE2 into urine in COVID could impact susceptibility and angiotensin metabolism. 2024.
