INTRODUCTION National health policies to stop the spread of the COVID19 virus in the US resulted in widespread school closures and disrupted learning in Spring 2020. METHODS This study draws on unique individuallevel data from n 282 512 year olds enrolled in the NIH Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes ECHO Research Program to investigate associations between caregiverreported duration of Spring 2020 learning disruptions and academic achievement. RESULTS Linear regression analyses estimated that children who experienced more than 4 weeks of instruction disruptions in Spring 2020 scored 4.5 points 95 CI 8.77, 0.22 lower on agenormed math assessments compared to peers who had four or fewer weeks of disruption, adjusting for sociodemographic variables, prepandemic vocabulary, and COVID19 family hardships and stress. No differences were found for reading. Children whose caregivers had higher levels of pandemicrelated traumatic stress and lower educational attainment also had lower math scores, adjusting for all other covariates. DISCUSSION Results suggest educators and schools focus additional attention on supporting math instruction for children who experienced extended learning disruptions.
