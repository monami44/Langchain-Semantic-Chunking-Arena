4.35, p 0.001 was significantly higher compared to that before. Conversely, the proportion of patients with hepatitis B virus 3.69 vs. 10.14, p 0.006 and herpes simplex virus type I 1.23 vs. 4.35, p 0.04 infections was significantly lower after the infection. Additionally, preSARSCoV2 infection factors associated with opportunistic infections in IBD include duration of illness, red blood cell count, the presence of comorbid chronic illnesses, and alcohol consumption, while postSARSCoV2 infection, the primary risk factors involve corticosteroid use, red blood cell count, protein level, and highsensitivity Creactive protein. CONCLUSION After the SARSCoV2 infection, there has been a shift in the occurrence of opportunistic infections among IBD patients. It might be attributed to the use of corticosteroids and also the strengthening of containment measures, heightened public health awareness, and widespread vaccination.
