Author information 1Department of Education and Social Sciences, Lebanese American University, Lebanon. In this technological era, the implementation of Information and Communication Technology ICT into the learning environment is impacted by many factors, chief among them are those related to the teachers whose experience and attitude play a key role in the proper integration of technology. This study purports to investigate the effect of teachers experience on their attitude towards ICT integration and their level of usage in the classroom. It used a quantitative descriptive method by adopting two surveys HernándezRamos et al., 2014 and Sánchez et al., 2012 as the main instrument for data collection. The survey was administered in four English language private urban schools in Lebanon. This study shows that the teachers hold an overall positive attitude towards ICT integration in the classroom. However, no significant relationship between their attitude and years of experience is identified. While teachers demonstrate a moderate to low ICT usage, a significant negative correlation between their use of ICT in the classroom and their years of experience is evident. These findings are not consistent with the prevalent literature that tends to associate positive attitudes towards technology with higher usage of ICT in different educational settings around the world. Limitations of the study and recommendations for sustainable implementation of ICT in the classroom are provided. 2024 The Authors.
