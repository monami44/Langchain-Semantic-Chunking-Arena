More than threefourths of the respondents were in their early careers 64.1 per cent were resident doctors, and 19.8 per cent were early career consultants. Maximum responses were received from respondents working in neurology 228 45.2, followed by psychiatry 192 38.1 and neurosurgery 49 9.7. More than threefourths 83.5, 95 confidence interval CI 0.80.867 of the respondents reported that the pandemic had affected their research. About onethird of the respondents 171 33.9 reported delays in completing research studies. Respondents adapted to the pandemics circumstances by making methodological changes in their research 155 30.8. Most respondents 301 59.6 reported being diverted from their traditional work settings to COVID19related clinical services. Respondents conducting prospective studies and randomized controlled trials and those diverted to COVIDrelated services were significantly more likely to report the adverse research impact. Interpretation conclusions In our survey, an overwhelming majority of the respondents reported that the pandemic adversely impacted their study. This trend was independent of sex, designation, and research output of individual subjects. The serious impact of the COVID19 pandemic on neurosciences research warrants the attention and concerted efforts of the research supervisors, institutional heads, funding agencies and other stakeholders.
