INTRODUCTION Prior to the coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 pandemic the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA had the largest telehealth program in the United States. The pandemic motivated providers within the VA to expand telehealth in effort to reduce disrupted care while mitigating risks. The pandemic provides a rare opportunity to examine how to better engage veterans experiencing housing instability HI in telehealth diabetes care. METHODS Mixed methods design to examine VA video connect VVC diabetes care utilization among veterans experiencing HI from March 1, 2019, to March 1, 2022, combining multivariable regression analyses of VA administrative data with semistructured interviews. Study aims included a examine changes in diabetes care delivery mode over the peripandemic timeframe b identify sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with VVC care among veterans with HI and c understand the facilitators and barriers of VVC utilization. RESULTS Totally, 5904 veterans were eligible for study analysis. Veterans who are female OR 1.63 95 CI 1.3, 2.0 p 0.0001, selfidentify as Hispanic OR 1.44 95 CI 1.1, 1.9 p 0.02, are married OR 1.39 95 CI 1.2, 1.6 p 0.0001, and are in VA priority group 1 OR 1.21 95 CI 1.1, 1.4 p 0.004 were more likely to use VVC the pandemic. Veterans of older age OR 0.97 95 CI 0.97, 0.98 p .0001 and rural dwelling OR 0.85 95 CI 0.7, 1.2 p 0.04, were less likely to use VVC. Thirteen VA providers and 15 veterans were interviewed. Veterans reported that decisions about using VVC were driven by limitations in inperson care availability, safety, and convenience. DISCUSSION Telehealth played an important role in providing veterans with HI access to diabetes care during the pandemic. Future interventions should seek to increase education and technology in effort to increase VVC uptake into routine diabetes care to ensure veterans optimal and equitable access. The Authors 2024.
