The use of drugs offlabel for managing COVID19 offers a potential approach. Among these potential drugs, tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor, is strongly implicated in its ability to mitigate mortality by attenuating the cytokine storm syndrome. This study systematically reviewed and quantitatively assessed the effectiveness and safety profile of tofacitinib use through metaanalysis. Through searches of the PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases up to May 31, 2024, six articles meeting inclusion criteria were identified, encompassing 669 patients diagnosed with COVID19. The review findings indicate that tofacitinib use demonstrates significant clinical efficacy, as evidenced by a reduced risk of mortality P 0.003, and a decreased need for invasive mechanical ventilation P 0.0002. Furthermore, tofacitinib use is not correlated with an increased risk of adverse drug reactions P 0.98, indicating a favorable safety profile. In conclusion, the evidence supports the clinical efficacy of tofacitinib for COVID19 patients without concomitant risks of adverse effects. Further clinical studies, especially largerscale randomized controlled trials, are necessary to validate the findings of this study. 2024 The Authors.
