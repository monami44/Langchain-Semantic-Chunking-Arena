BACKGROUND Position change and interventions to increase lung capacity should be considered in mechanically ventilated patients. The most effective of these is the prone position. AIM This systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to determine the effects of the prone position on respiratory parameters and outcomes and to guide nurses working in the intensive care unit. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This systematic reviewmetaanalysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting in Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guideline. ScienceDirect, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete EBSCOhost, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane and PubMed databases were searched between January 2022 and January 2023 to access studies related to prone position in COVID19 patients. RESULTS Twentythree studies were included. This metaanalysis shows that a prone position is feasible and can achieve improvements in gas exchange. Prone position increases PaO2FiO2 in the majority of patients followed with a diagnosis of COVID19 and severe hypoxemic. CONCLUSIONS The study has shown that the prone position is effective in improving patients respiratory function and oxygenation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The results presented in this article support the notion that the prone position can be an effective strategy in the clinical management of COVID19 patients. 2024 British Association of Critical Care Nurses.
