This research aims to select products that will be used for promotion on ecommerce platforms. The increasing use of ecommerce has led to a high level of competition in the ecommerce field. The company strives to maintain the quality of its services to increase customer satisfaction, one of which is by providing regular promotions. The process of selecting promotional products is a routine activity carried out every week. However, the current promotional product selection process is not effective enough, and there are no criteria to use as a reference for selection. This research was conducted on two ecommerce companies actively operating in Indonesia. The research began with a literature study and expert survey to select important criteria in selecting promotional products. Weighting of important criteria is carried out using the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis SWARA method. Finally, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution TOPSIS method is used to rank the best products to promote. The results showed that products from Soundcore, Lenovo, and Xiaomi were the best products with preference values of 0.83, 0.65, and 0.60 respectively.
