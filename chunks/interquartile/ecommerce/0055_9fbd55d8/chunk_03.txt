Findings CBEC to China is gaining increasing interest, as shown by the rising amount of publications from 2013 onwards. Within these contributions, however, studies specifically investigating the relation between logistics and ecommerce, commonly acknowledged as critical, seem to lack.

Stemming from the review, a set of possible development areas are identified, including distribution network design, i.e. deciding how to shape the CBEC distribution structure, and logistics outsourcing, i.e. determining whether to manage logistics activities inhouse or through third parties. Originalityvalue To the extent of the authors knowledge, this paper is the first one to classify the existing body of knowledge on logistics supporting CBEC.
