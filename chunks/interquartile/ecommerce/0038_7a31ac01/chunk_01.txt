Social commerce is a form of commerce mediated by social media and social network services SNS. As a multifaceted phenomenon, social commerce can be studied from different angles and analyzed through the lens of various disciplines. This article examines website technical features to depict the transformation of ecommerce into social commerce.

Then, we use the framework to conduct an historical analysis of the actual website screen captures for five top ecommerce companies since their websites were established. We were able to identify and classify a total of 174 emerging technical features.
