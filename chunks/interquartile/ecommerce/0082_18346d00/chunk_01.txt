Growth in ecommerce has led to increasing use of light goods vehicles for parcel deliveries in urban areas. This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by eretailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the lastmile operation, as well as the duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the lastmile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62 of the total vehicle round time and 40 of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for lastmile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on lastmile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made meeting delivery time windows firsttime delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with lastmile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels.
