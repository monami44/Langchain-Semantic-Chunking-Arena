Using these data in combination with census data, the paper addresses a number of key questions. After outlining key trends in the dataset on ecommerce usage by product and over time the first research question is How do ecommerce purchases vary by geodemographic group? To answer this question, we explore ecommerce usage by age, sex and social class. The second key question is Does ecommerce usage vary by type of geographical region? Thus, we explore variations in usage for urban and rural areas. The dynamics of urbanrural diffusion are also addressed here by examining, in addition, the spread of broadband use across Britain. The last question is To what degree do ecommerce sales vary by access to physical stores? This is addressed by examining consumers home locations in relation to geographical accessibility. The results show that age and income are crucial demographic discriminators of ecommerce usage, as is rural location versus urban, and distance from physical stores.
