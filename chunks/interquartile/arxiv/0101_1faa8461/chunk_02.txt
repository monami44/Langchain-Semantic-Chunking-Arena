The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISPDM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support but lacks to address machine learning specific tasks. Our work proposes an industry and application neutral process model tailored for machine learning applications with focus on technical tasks for quality assurance.
