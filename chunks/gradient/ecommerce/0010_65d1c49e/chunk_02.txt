A survey of 292 SMEs shows that the majority of them are still at an early stage in their adoption of ecommerce. Their use of ecommerce is dominated by marketing and purchasing and procurement activities. Extending market reach, increased sales, improved external communication, improved company image, improved speed of processing, and increased employee productivity are reported as the top six ecommerce benefits perceived by these SMEs. This study also shows that SMEs at the higher level of ecommerce adoption experience greater ecommerce benefits than those at other levels of adoption.
