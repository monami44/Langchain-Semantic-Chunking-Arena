Blockchain has the potential to shake the foundation of ecommerce by enabling exchange relations that are trustless and operate without dedicated intermediaries or even central authorities in the case of permissionless blockchains. Furthermore, the exchange of information and value between companies and consumers might change considerably by enabling unified access to immutable data along the entire supply chain. In this paper, a framework and 19 highlevel research questions are developed to inspire researchers to closely investigate the potential impact of blockchain on ecommerce. The main categories include a technological, b legal and c organizational and quality issues as well as d consumer issues. This paper illustrates how blockchain potentially impacts different elements of ecommerce in these respective areas.
