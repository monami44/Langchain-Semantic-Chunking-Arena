In addition, the paper examines the mediating role of perceived functional value and perceived emotional value. Survey data collected 372 crossborder online consumers from China and the PLSSEM method was used to empirically test the proposed model. The results show that these four crossborder online shopping context cues have a significantly positive impact on consumers purchase intention. Brand familiarity has significantly negative moderating effects between the four cues and the perceived functional value, while brand familiarity also negatively moderates the relationship between online promotion cues, social review cues, and perceived emotional value, respectively.
