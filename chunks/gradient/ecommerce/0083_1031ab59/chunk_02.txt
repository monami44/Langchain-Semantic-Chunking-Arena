Findings from three experiments provide evidence that consumers prefer channels with medium e.g., ecommerce and high e.g., instore media richness for carrying out complex decisionmaking tasks. Findings reveal that consumers are likely to undertake simple decisionmaking tasks on channels that incorporate low e.g., mcommerce levels of media richness. Findings also demonstrate that product type moderates the effect of media richness on perceived channeltask fit, postpurchase evaluation, and channel choice. These insights should prove helpful to managers in managing content across different channels.
