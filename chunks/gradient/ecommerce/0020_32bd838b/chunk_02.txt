Designmethodologyapproach A literature review is used to determine the conceptual model and develop the measurement scales. Data are collected through a web survey mainly conducted in China. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the collected data and test the research hypotheses. Findings The results verify the proposed service quality framework, consisting of two dimensions electronic service eservice quality and logistics service quality, in the ecommerce context. The results indicate that eservice quality and logistics service quality are strongly linked to customer satisfaction that is, with eservice and logistics service, respectively. eService quality positively impacts customer satisfaction with logistics services, but logistics service quality negatively impacts customer satisfaction with eservices. Moreover, customer satisfaction with eservices is positively associated with customer loyalty for both eservices and logistics services. However, customer satisfaction with logistics services has no direct impact on related customer loyalty, and negatively impacts customer loyalty with eservices. Research limitationsimplications The survey focusses only on China future data should verify whether different cultural backgrounds will impact the research results. Practical implications The results show that eretailers should not only focus on eservice quality, but also logistics service quality, which is critical to the success of ecommerce. Originalityvalue A twodimensional eservice and logistics service quality framework is proposed and empirically assessed in the context of the eretailing supply chain. These impacts of the path of service quality on customer satisfaction and loyalty are highlighted.
