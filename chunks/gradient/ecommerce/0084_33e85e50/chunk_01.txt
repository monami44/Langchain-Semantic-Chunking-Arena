Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold first, to review and classify scientific publications dealing with those innovative solutions aimed at increasing the efficiency of lastmile delivery in business to consumer B2C ecommerce and, second, to outline directions for future research in this field. Designmethodologyapproach The review is based on 75 papers published between 2001 and 2019 in international peerreviewed journals or proceedings of conferences, retrieved from bibliographic databases and science search engines. Findings Due to its importance in affecting the overall logistics costs and, as a consequence, the economic sustainability of a B2C ecommerce initiative, lastmile delivery process deserves particular attention in order to be optimised. The review highlights that, among the main factors affecting its cost, there are the probability to have failed deliveries, the customer density in the delivery areas and the degree of automation of the process. Innovative and viable lastmile delivery solutions which may impact the mentioned drivers include parcel lockers, crowdsourcing logistics, mapping the consumer presence at home and dynamic pricing policies.
