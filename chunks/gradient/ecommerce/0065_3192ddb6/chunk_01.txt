The diffusion of ecommerce has played a significant role in recent rural economic development in China. Ecommerce is also considered as an efficient channel to alleviate poverty in rural China. Voluminous studies have investigated the contribution of ecommerce to agricultural development, yet it is lacking empirical evidence as to the effects of ecommerce on rural poverty alleviation. Since the year of 2014, in order to develop rural ecommerce, Chinese government launched the National Rural Ecommerce Comprehensive Demonstration Project. This gradual involvement policy offered a natural experiment for evaluation of ecommerce. Based on villagelevel survey data from rural China and Heckit method, our study finds that rural ecommerce has a significantly positive effect on rural income.
