1. Because the universe of social commerce websites is somewhat incommensurable and a plethora of new websites is added to the World Wide Web every day, the selection of relevant cases for examination is challenging. To avoid bias or an arbitrary selection, we selected websites according to the most recent list of top social commerce websites, published in 2008, by the renowned blog Social Media Trader11 httpwww.socialmediatrader.com , which compiled the monthly traffic data from three different sources Compete, Quantcast and MSN Adlabs. The original list contained 17 websites, among which Zebo www.zebo.com is no longer in activity and Glimpse www.glimpse.com is not accessible.
