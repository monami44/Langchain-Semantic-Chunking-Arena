Previous works adopt an EmbeddingMLP paradigm raw features are embedded into lowdimensional vectors, which are then fed on to MLP for final recommendations. However, most of these works just concatenate different features, ignoring the sequential nature of users behaviors. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful Transformer model to capture the sequential signals underlying users behavior sequences for recommendation in Alibaba. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which is then deployed online at Taobao and obtain significant improvements in online ClickThroughRate CTR comparing to two baselines.
