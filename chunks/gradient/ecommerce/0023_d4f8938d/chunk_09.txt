The web environment makes it difficult to set the boundaries of where a consumer starts or ends a shopping activity. Furthermore, not all consumers access online stores with the final purpose of buying online. Some might use those spaces essentially for collecting impressions and opinions which can support their decisions about a selected product which will be purchased in another online or brick and mortar site. In this sense, the literature analyzes and the empirical study discloses a broader view of the concept. Collectively, social commerce can be understood as the activities by which people shop or intentionally explore shopping opportunities by participating andor engaging in a collaborative online environment. There is clearly a lack of consensus on what is defined as a social commerce website. For example, Amarasinghe 2010 presents an idea of a true social commerce website, where the social commerce business model is a result of the intersection of an ecommerce firm and social network websites in order to avoid scalability and revenue models traps Figure 2. Nonetheless, even the author questions whether some examples really fit the true business model. Based on the analysis of the 15 websites, we establish a preliminary categorization for social commerce websites direct sales and referrals. Direct sales this category includes those social commerce websites that count on an internal fulltransaction platform for commercialization, such as Amazon and Etsy, from which, if desired, consumers can complete the full purchase cycle without being directed to third parties. Amazon is an example of B2C blending internal socialization between consumers, whereas Etsy follows a C2C approach through a community centered market place composed by artists and collectors who buy and sell on the website.
