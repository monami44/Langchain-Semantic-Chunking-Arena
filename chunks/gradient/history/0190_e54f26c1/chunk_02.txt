Individuals who experienced war episodes as children hold less and are less likely to hold stocks, but are more likely to hold life insurance, compared to nonexposed individuals. Effects are robust to the inclusion of potential mediating factors, and are tested for nonlinearity and heterogeneity. Moreover, we provide evidence of hedonic adaptation to war, as high and low intensity of war exposure have comparable longterm effects. We also document that war exposure in childhood increases sensitivity to financial uncertainty since exposedtowar individuals are less likely to hold stocks after periods of high volatility. Finally, we shed light on the most likely mechanism in the relationship between war exposure and financial risk taking i.e., enhanced sensitivity to uncertainty and we show that preferences, and not beliefs, channel this relationship.
