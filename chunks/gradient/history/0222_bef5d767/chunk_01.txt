Abstract This work links the western Allies policy of denazification in occupied Germany to efforts to repatriate German intelligence agents and Nazi Party officials socalled obnoxious Germans from the neutral states of Europe after the Second World War. Once on German soil, these individuals would be subject to internment and investigation as outlined in occupation policy. Using the situation in Francos Spain as a case study, the article argues that new ideas of neutrality following the war and a strong commitment to the concept of denazification led to the creation of the repatriation policy, especially within the United States. Repatriation was also a way to measure the extent to which Francos Spain accepted the Allied victory and the defeat of Nazism and fascism.
