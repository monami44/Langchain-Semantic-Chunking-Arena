Emotional reactions were measured using physiological signals of heart rate and heart rate variability as well as selfreport. Emotions experienced were mixed and often, but not always, different between Dutch and German participants. Patterns in the physiological and selfreport data differed. Many of the significant differences were generally consistent with a collective guilt account of German social identity, but the findings as a whole were more complex than could be predicted by existing social identity accounts. Specifically, participants did not simply categorize themselves with either national or human identities of characters based on what their respective stories emphasized. We conclude that stories of the Second World War are still relevant, but touch on audiences nationalities in a complex way, beyond simple historical categories.
