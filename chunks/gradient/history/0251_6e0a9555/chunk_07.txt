41 Sulamaa, Himmetä ei muistot koskaan saa, 3023 editorial, Kansa taisteli, no. 5 1986 147. 42 On the Finnish readership of war literature until the end of 1980s, Niemi, Viime sotien kirjat, 194203. 43 From 1945 until the 1970s, the social democrats and the peoples democrats gained about 45 of the vote in national elections today, the comparable share of the left is less than 30. 44 A division into bourgeois and workingclass unions would only be true as a general characterization. In practice, both unions tended to lean towards the centre and the local differences between the unions were often quite unclear and complicated, see Sulamaa, Veteraania ei jätetä, 402, 1919 Tuomisto, Etulinjassa, 838, 11317. 45 These key war veteran figures, close to President Kekkonen and active in the Finnish foreign policy of the 1970s, included, for instance, longtime prime and foreign minister Ahti Karjalainen, twotime prime minister and later president Mauno Koivisto, and foreign minister albeit for a rather short period Väinö Leskinen. 46 The complexity of the issue can be illustrated by the fact that probably the two most despised Finnish politicians among the hardcore communist youth radicals of the 1970s were indeed war veterans, Aarne Saarinen and Ele Alenius, but Saarinen also happened to be the chairman of the Finnish Communist Party and Alenius the leader of the peoples democrats. Eino S. Repo, the head of the Finnish Broadcasting Company in the 1960s and allegedly responsible for its radicalization, had also been a frontline officer. 47 Juujärvi, Pesso, and Salin, Sotiemme veteraanien identiteetti, 846. 48 Jokisipilä, Kappas vaan, saksalaisia this debate is so longlasting and nuanced that it is not fruitful to describe it here in detail for summaries in German and English, see Kinnunen, Finnische Kriegserinnerung Meinander, A Separate Story Jokisipilä, Finnish History Culture and Kivimäki, Three Wars and Their Epitaphs. 49 Junila, Kotirintaman aseveljeyttä, 312, 82, 13646, 286304. 50 Jokisipilä, Aseveljiä vai liittolaisia, 3616. 51 Ahto, Aseveljet vastakkain, 67, 21526 Junila, Kotirintaman aseveljeyttä, 623, 82. 52 As described in the abovecited title of Sampo Ahtos history of the Lapland War, Aseveljet vastakkain, which translates as brothersinarms against each other. 53 This is also true regarding the wartime resistance movement during the Continuation War, a few Finnish communists did organize some minor sabotages, but they remained practically irrelevant. 54 Vares, Kuitenkin me voitimme, 184. 55 Rautkallio, Politik und Volk, 21417. Some Finnish Jews who served in contact with German troops were even awarded the Iron Cross, and the German military was surprised to learn that the Finnish Army in Eastern Karelia had established a field synagogue for its Jewish soldiers.

The connection of the present Finnish memory culture of war to the growing populist rightwing sentiment would definitely require a study of its own. 67 Raivo, This Is Where They Fought, 15963. 68 Meinander, Suomi 1944, 3958. 69 Aamulehti, 28 November 2009. 70 Meinander, A Separate Story?, 714. 71 Torsti, Suomalaisten moniulotteiset sotakuvat. 72 See Stråth, Nordic Foundation Myths, 1648. 73 On the troubles of including this European memory trend into the Finnish memory culture, see Silvennoinen, Still Under Examination Holmila, Varieties of Silence. 74 See, e.g., Bucur, Heroes and Victims, passim Ungváry, The Siege of Budapest, 357. 75 On the political uses of wartime history and memory, see Torsti, Suomalaisten moniulotteiset sotakuvat, 3223. 76 As the war veterans now have a special status as a moral authority, we have already seen individual veterans opinions, or wholly imagined and generalized veteran opinion, mobilized to oppose a multitude of issues, such as contemporary art and theatre performances, the selling of land property to Russians, refugee and immigration policies, the compulsory teaching of Swedish language at schools, and lately also gays dancing at the presidents annual Independence Day reception, to name just a few examples. Furthermore, during the present economic crisis the Spirit of the Winter War has been called forth to support national consensus at the face of economic austerity and budget cuts.
