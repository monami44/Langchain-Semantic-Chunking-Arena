Indications of this shift from production to design can be seen particularly clearly in the rising cultural capital of the London brand in midmarket readytowear fashions for women. By focusing on this sector of the industry, this paper adds a new perspective to previous studies of postwar fashion by looking beyond the activities of a narrow band of highend fashion houses. From the geographies of manufacturing to the symbolic use of London postcodes on garment labels, it compiles a comprehensive impression of the significant role played by Londons midmarket fashion manufacturers in managing the fashionable reputation of the city at a time when its industry faced catastrophic decline and reflects on how this shaped Londons development as a fashion city in subsequent decades.
