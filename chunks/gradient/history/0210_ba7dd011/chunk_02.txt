The Nazi German troops established a large military base there in 1941, and the Germans and the villagers lived as close neighbours for several years. In 1944 the villagers were evacuated before the outbreak of the FinnoGerman Lapland War of 19441945, in which the German troops annihilated their military installations and the civilian infrastructure. Today the ruins of demolished German military installations persist around the village as vivid reminders, and act for the villagers as important active agents in memorising this vital phase in Laplands recent past. They also appear to facilitate nostalgia for the more independent days before traditional SÃ¡mi lifeways were ruptured by stronger Finnish State intervention in the postwar decades.
