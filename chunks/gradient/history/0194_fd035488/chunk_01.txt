Concrete fortifications have long served as battlescarred memorials of the Second World War. The forests of northwest Europe, meanwhile, have concealed a preserved landscape of earthwork field fortifications, military support structures and bomb and shellcraters that promise to enhance our understanding of the conflict landscapes of the 1944 Normandy Campaign and the subsequent battles in the Ardennes and Hürtgenwald forests. Recent survey has revealed that the archaeology surviving in wooded landscapes can significantly enhance our understanding of ground combat in areas covered by forest.
