Our attempts to model persecution and its effects on their trajectories raised a certain number of methodological issues, mostly dealing with the linearity of the causal schema implied by our approach is it appropriate to reduce choices made under tragic circumstances to their social determinants? To conceptualize our data as trajectories of persecution seems to offer interesting prospects for overcoming some of these difficulties. By moving from a logic of properties to a logic of sequential states, and from a logic of causes to a logic of paths, we describe, order and interpret the plurality of trajectories, yet without abandoning quantification.
