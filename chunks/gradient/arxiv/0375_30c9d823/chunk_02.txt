Similar studies have helped in other security fields to discover root causes or improve risk communication. Our study reveals two facets of practitioners mental models of machine learning security. Firstly, practitioners often confuse machine learning security with threats and defences that are not directly related to machine learning. Secondly, in contrast to most academic research, our participants perceive security of machine learning as not solely related to individual models, but rather in the context of entire workflows that consist of multiple components. Jointly with our additional findings, these two facets provide a foundation to substantiate mental models for machine learning security and have implications for the integration of adversarial machine learning into corporate workflows, newdecreasing practitioners reported uncertainty, and appropriate regulatory frameworks for machine learning security.
