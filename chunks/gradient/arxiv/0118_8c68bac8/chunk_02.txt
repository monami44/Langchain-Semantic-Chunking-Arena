Similarly, we propose that machine learning interpretability should be a discipline that answers specific questions related to interpretability. These questions can be of statistical, causal and counterfactual nature. Therefore, there is a need to look into the interpretability problem of machine learning in the context of questions that need to be addressed rather than different tools. We discuss about a hypothetical interpretability framework driven by a question based scientific approach rather than some specific machine learning model. Using a question based notion of interpretability, we can step towards understanding the science of machine learning rather than its engineering. This notion will also help us understanding any specific problem more in depth rather than relying solely on machine learning methods.
