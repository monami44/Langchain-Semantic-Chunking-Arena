Machine learning on graphs has been extensively studied in both academic and industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graphrelated tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine learning AutoML on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community. Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily focusing on hyperparameter optimization HPO and neural architecture search NAS for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to automated graph machine learning and indepth discuss AutoGL, the first dedicated opensource library for AutoML on graphs.
