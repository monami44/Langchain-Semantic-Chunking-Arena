In this position paper, I first describe a new perspective on machine learning ML by four basic problems or levels, namely, What to learn?, How to learn?, What to evaluate?, and What to adjust?. The paper stresses more on the first level of What to learn?, or Learning Target Selection. Towards this primary problem within the four levels, I briefly review the existing studies about the connection between information theoretical learning ITL 1 and machine learning. A theorem is given on the relation between the empiricallydefined similarity measure and information measures.
