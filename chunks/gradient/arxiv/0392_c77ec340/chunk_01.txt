The problem of learning automata from example traces but no equivalence or membership queries is fundamental in automata learning theory and practice. In this paper we study this problem for finite state machines with inputs and outputs, and in particular for Moore machines. We develop three algorithms for solving this problem 1 the PTAP algorithm, which transforms a set of inputoutput traces into an incomplete Moore machine and then completes the machine with selfloops 2 the PRPNI algorithm, which uses the wellknown RPNI algorithm for automata learning to learn a product of automata encoding a Moore machine and 3 the MooreMI algorithm, which directly learns a Moore machine using PTAP extended with state merging.
