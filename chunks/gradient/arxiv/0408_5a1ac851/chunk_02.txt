Typically the bias is supplied by hand, for example through the choice of an appropriate set of features. However, if the learning machine is embedded within an em environment of related tasks, then it can em learn its own bias by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment. In this paper two models of bias learning or equivalently, learning to learn are introduced and the main theoretical results presented. The first model is a PACtype model based on empirical process theory, while the second is a hierarchical Bayes model.
