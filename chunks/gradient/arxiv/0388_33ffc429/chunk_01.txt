The term interpretability is oftenly used by machine learning researchers each with their own intuitive understanding of it. There is no universal well agreed upon definition of interpretability in machine learning. As any type of science discipline is mainly driven by the set of formulated questions rather than by different tools in that discipline, e.g. astrophysics is the discipline that learns the composition of stars, not as the discipline that use the spectroscopes.
