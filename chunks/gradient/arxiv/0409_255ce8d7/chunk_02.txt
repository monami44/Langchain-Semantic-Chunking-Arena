At the same time, machine learning experts warn that machine learning models can be biased as well. In this article, our goal is to explain the issue of bias in machine learning from a technical perspective and to illustrate the impact that biased data can have on a machine learning model. To reach such a goal, we develop interactive plots to visualizing the bias learned from synthetic data.
