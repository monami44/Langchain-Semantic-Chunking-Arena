In the last reform of its internal justice system, initiated in 2017, the EBRD revised the first stage of its system with the aim to enhance its speed and effectiveness, at a reasonable cost for the staff members and the EBRD. Bearing in mind that the main purpose of the first stage is to establish the facts of the matter in dispute and to report the findings and recommendations to the EBRD President for decision, the EBRD has now evolved towards a more inquisitorial process. In force since February 2018, the new first stage of EBRDs internal justice system offers the necessary due process and fairness to staff members for the review of their grievances, without transforming the committee conducting that stage into a quasijudicial body. After all, the purpose of the first stage of the system is to deliver a report and recommendation to the EBRD President, assisting them in their consideration of the matter in dispute.
