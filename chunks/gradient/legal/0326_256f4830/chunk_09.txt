Various authors present embryo storage data in the United States from a 2002 survey as roughly 400,000 embryos cryopreserved and a 2011 survey noting 615,000 embryos cryopreserved. Arguably, a straight linear projection of an increase of roughly 50 over 9 years would hold that today there may be upwards of 900,000 embryos cryopreserved. This number, however, does not consider the use of new treatment protocols for reducing ovarian response and the creation of fewer embryos per cycle, nor the increasing use of oocyte freezing. Therefore, with a calculated 900,000 to 1,000,000 embryos currently in storage in the United States alone, storage limitations and final disposition arrangements are significant factors in establishing practical approaches to the fill gaps left by current regulations and guidelines. Cryostorage processes for sperm, eggs, and embryos inside the fertility clinic should address the potential known and foreseeable risks associated with cryopreservation, such as specimen loss due to equipment failure or human error, loss as a result of mislabeling, accidental destruction, reduced viability over time, crosscontamination of specimens, and staff safety 32Schiewe M.C.
