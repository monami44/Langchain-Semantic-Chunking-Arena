Vested with privileges and immunities, international organizations are neither subject to the substantive provisions of national employment law, nor to the jurisdiction of national labour courts or similar domestic judicial authorities for the adjudication of labour disputes. Nevertheless, it is generally recognised that staff members of international organizations are entitled to have their grievances about decisions of the organization concerning their employment be heard by an internal dispute resolution mechanism, including the right to appeal such decisions to a judicial authority for an independent review. As an international organization promoting the rule of law in the countries where it operates, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development EBRD has regularly adapted since its creation its internal dispute resolution mechanism to emerging legal trends, and the everincreasing requirements of the case law of international administrative tribunals.
