The European Environment Agency portal into data on this topic is online at httpwww.eea.europa.euthemesbiodiversitywherewestandwheredoeseuropestandin2010 accessed 30 July 2013.18 Ferranti, Beunen, Speranza 2010, supra note 14.19 Beunen, Van Assche, Duineveld 2013, supra note 2, at 280.20 This thesis emerges from several strands of work on Europeanization and domestic political change and is masterfully applied to compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives in Ireland in Laffan OMahony 2008, supra note 14.21 The sense that beneath all the twists and turns of litigation, court decisions, administrative adaptations, and interest group strategizing swirling around the Directives there lies a basic set of questions about power over land use, which are enduring and may have no clear resolution emerges very clearly from the account of proposals for British port development in Morris 2011, supra note 14. Raoul Beunen and his colleagues are equally clear that in the Netherlands the preoccupation with procedural compliance has not led to substantive success for wildlife values. They point out that in the beginning compliance was treated as a mere formality, because the Dutch conservation model was considered to be the model for the European directives. Beunen, Van Assche, Duineveld 2013, supra note 2, at 283. This changed after a small environmental NGO, Das en Boom, successfully used the Habitats directive to challenge in court the development of a new business park in Heerlen. Their legal victory stirred a lot of media attention. According to Das en Boom, the permitting process was incomplete since the impact studies required by the Habitats directive were not conducted. The judges agreed. After a string of court cases, many actors became aware of the potential impact of the Birds and Habitats directives. In the following years, more developments and activities were challenged including the extension of the A73 highway, the fishing rights for cockles in the Wadden Sea and the enlargement of the Port of Rotterdam.
