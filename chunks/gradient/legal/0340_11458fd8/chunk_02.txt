See e.g., J. Holder M. Lee, Environmental Protection, Law, and Policy Text and Materials 2nd ed. 2007 at 627669 and the reappraisal of Lysters assessment at various points in M. Bowman, P. Davies, C. Redgwell, Lysters International Wildlife Law 2nd ed., 2010. Although, as a recent essay perceptively notes, when you look at the fine print The Habitats directive stipulates a procedure for balancing species and habitat protection on one hand and potentially harmful human activities on the other. But the directive does not address how nature and human activities have to be balanced, where the deliberation should take place, whether it should be embedded in existing mechanisms for spatial planning or not, or which kind of rules and policies should be employed in the implementation. It only stipulates that valuable habitats require delineation and protection in EU member states, and that this protection needs to have consequences for human use i.e. it ought to provoke an informed discussion whenever human use threatens to alter these highquality habitats emphasis added and references omitted.
