Poly 293 2010.59 As Edwards notes, the provisions of the Habitats Directive are implemented in the context of European treaty law. Article 1912 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU TFEU premises EU environmental policy on the need to provide a high level of protection for the environment, based in part on the precautionary principle and preventive action. These prescriptions, Edwards argues, ought to be binding on domestic courts, in which case they might facilitate substantive review. Although Article 1912 probably does not have direct effect, it is a prescriptive provision of the TFEU and, as such, is binding on domestic courts. This follows from Article 43 of the Treaty on European Union TEU ex Article 10 of the EC Treaty. Further, the new provision in Article 191 of the TEU, requiring Member States to provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law, arguably bolsters the established case under Article 43 TEU concerning the duties of domestic courts to ensure the full effectiveness of EU law even where EU law rules do not have direct effect citations omitted.

Precisely similar concerns lie behind Bradley Karkkainen, Toward a Smarter NEPA Monitoring and Managing Governments Environmental Performance, 102 Colum. L. Rev. 903 2002. Other disturbing aspects of enforcement are noted by Clutten and Tafur in their discussion of IROPI In relation to all the cases in which IROPI has been justified, compensatory measures will be put in place But there is nothing in Article 64, or in the Commission guidance of 2007 about how to implement the Article which requires the Commission to ensure that compensatory measures are actually taken. The Commission does not take action against Member States if they fail to implement the compensatory measures to which they have committed, even if a favorable opinion is given by the Commission on the basis of those measures being taken citation omitted.
