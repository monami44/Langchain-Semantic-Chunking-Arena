and Would you want to be kept alive as a vegetable? can yield inaccurate and conflicting answers. It has been shown that patients deciding resuscitation preferences during an acute hospitalization frequently reverse their decisions over the next few months.56Therefore, optimal shared decision making requires that patient preferences have been discussed previously and documented in the ambulatory setting. The day of hospital admission is a time to review and possibly update, rather than introduce, advanced care decisions. On the other hand, once the clinical course has become apparent during hospitalization, clinicians can take advantage of the substantial time they have with the patient and family to further address complex medical decisions before discharge. When the expected survival or quality of life is very limited, hospitalization may also afford better access to multidisciplinary teams, palliative care, and other resources than can be marshaled in the outpatient setting. All of these considerations underscore the importance of a proactive, anticipatory, and iterative approach to soliciting patients preferences. This should occur both routinely and at the occurrence of milestones that herald a worsening prognosis Table 4.Table 4.
