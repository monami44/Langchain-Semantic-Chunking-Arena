Shared decision making recognizes that there are complex tradeoffs in the choice of medical care.1 Shared decision making also addresses the ethical need to fully inform patients about the risks and benefits of treatments.2 In the setting of multiple reasonable options for medical care, shared decision making involves clinicians working with patients to ensure that patients values, goals, and preferences guide informed decisions that are right for each individual patient.Grounded in the ethical principle of autonomy,3 judicial decisions eg, Cruzan v Missouri Department of Health4 and legislative actions eg, the Patient SelfDetermination Act5 have repeatedly affirmed the rights of patients or duly appointed surrogates to choose their medical therapy from among reasonable options.6 The formal process of informed consent before procedural interventions is an embodiment of this concept in that it underscores the clinicians obligation to ensure that the patient has the opportunity to be informed.3 An informed patient is one who is aware of the diagnosis and prognosis, the nature of the proposed intervention, the risks and benefits of that intervention, and all reasonable alternatives and their associated risks and benefits.7 A major purpose of a highfunctioning healthcare system is to provide the resources with which an activated, informed patient can engage in productive discussions with a proactive, prepared healthcare team.8Shared decision making moves beyond informed consent. It asks that clinicians and patients share information with each other and work toward patientcentered decisions about treatment.9 Shared decision making incorporates the perspective of the patient, who is responsible for articulating goals, values, and preferences as they relate to his or her health care. Shared decision making incorporates the perspective of the clinician, who is responsible for narrowing the diagnostic and treatment options to those that are medically reasonable. Shared decision making is most easily applied to preferencesensitive decisions, in which both clinicians and patients agree that equipoise exists, and decision support helps patients think through, forecast, and deliberate their options. However, in situations in which clinicians hold the view that scientific evidence for benefit strongly outweighs harm, behavioral support eg, smoking cessation counseling designed to describe, justify, and recommend specific behavior may also be appropriate and complementary to decision support.10 Finally, certain therapeutic options may be considered unreasonable and therefore independent of patient demands, although situations of medical futility are relatively rare.6 Although not all patients will be able to clearly articulate decisions that are congruent with their stated goals, shared decision making aims to ensure that patients values, goals, and preferences are explored and incorporated into the medical decisionmaking process.Patientcentered medicine has been suggested as the next phase in health care.11 Shared decision making puts into practice the principle of patientcentered care, which the Institute of Medicine has identified as 1 of the 6 pillars of quality,12 with patientcentered care defined as providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.12 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act devotes 4 pages to patientcentered care, specifically calling for the development of decision aids, shared decisionmaking programs, and metrics for the quality of decision making.13It will be assumed throughout this document that discussions and decision making with patients also include, when appropriate, the family and other individuals involved, such as caregivers and companions.
