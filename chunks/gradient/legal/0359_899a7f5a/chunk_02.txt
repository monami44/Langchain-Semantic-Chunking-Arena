We thank an anonymous reviewer for emphasizing this important point. This fact scandalized specialists, including Bauer Citation2005. Arbeitsgericht München 2004, Neue Zeitschrift für ArbeitsrechtRechtsprechungsreport 101 4347. Däubler Citation2001 argued that the provision violated the Directive, while Koberski Citation2005 disagreed. The Court derived the right from various international instruments and the constitutional traditions common to the Member States. Including Bauer and Arnold Citation2006, Hailbronner 2008 and Preis Citation2006. Bundesverfassungsgericht 1993, BVerfGE 89, 155. In that ruling, the GFCC warned that it would invalidate any EU act having the effect of depriving German legislative organs of their control over legal norms created at the EU level. Private parties thereby possessed the right to plead the ultra vires nature of Community acts before all German judges, and to bring constitutional complaints alleging the same to the GFCC.
