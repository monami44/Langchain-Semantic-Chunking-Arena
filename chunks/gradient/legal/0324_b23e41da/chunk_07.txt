Inevitably, change will require European countries to adopt OECD guidance or something similar. However, it is doubtful that harmonized standards alone will have much impact. The lessons learned by the US Food and Drug Administration when they brought together Europe, Japan and the USA along with the pharmaceutical industry to set international standards for approving new drug applications might be a useful starting point to study successful efforts to harmonize regulations. Forging universal standards will be a longterm commitment that requires resources and participation from organizations such as the OECD, ESF and ORI to strengthen international collaborations and research integrity. Some of these issues will be discussed during the Second World Conference on Research Integrity, to be held in Singapore in July 2010. It would also be useful to advance towards an agreedupon definition of scientific misconduct, which is urgently needed to unify authority across various countries in order for progress to be made. Punishment makes no sense without prevention, and prevention of research misconduct is necessary because selfregulation is unlikely to be effective Bosch, 2008. With an overall budget of more than 51 billion, European authorities should not miss the opportunity to protect the Seventh Framework Research Programto run from 2007 to 2013and the ERC against this type of scientific crime.
