Amid frenzied national responses to COVID19, the world could soon reach a critical juncture to revisit and strengthen the International Health Regulations IHR, the multilateral instrument that governs how 196 states and WHO collectively address the global spread of disease.1Ghebreyesus TA WHO DirectorGenerals opening remarks at the World Health Assembly.

World Health Organization, Geneva2005Google Scholar In many countries, IHR obligations that are vital to an effective pandemic response remain unfulfilled, and the instrument has been largely sidelined in the COVID19 pandemic, the largest global health crisis in a century. It is time to reimagine the IHR as an instrument that will compel global solidarity and national action against the threat of emerging and reemerging pathogens. We call on state parties to reform the IHR to improve supervision, international assistance, dispute resolution, and overall textual clarity. First, the COVID19 pandemic highlights longstanding challenges in the identification of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern PHEIC. The IHR obliges states to notify WHO of any event that may constitute a PHEIC within 24 h after public health authorities assessment.2WHOInternational Health Regulations, WHA 58.3.2nd edn. World Health Organization, Geneva2005Google Scholar Evidence indicates that some public health authorities in Wuhan, China, suspected what later became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for several weeks before WHO was privy to the information.3Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020 395 497506Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus 32878 Google Scholar Without legal authority to independently visit China and review the outbreak situation, WHO faced a barrier in mounting a cogent global response. In a reimagined IHR, states should allow for information to be received from nonstate actors without being subject to verification from the state in question, as currently required by the IHR.2WHOInternational Health Regulations, WHA 58.3.2nd edn. World Health Organization, Geneva2005Google Scholar Moreover, national accountability should be strengthened by mandating independent experts to conduct missions to states so that they can review potential outbreak situations. Arms control treaties bear the strongest examples of such inspection mechanisms, but they have also been wielded in other realms of global health, principally the international drug control regime.4Taylor AL Addressing the global tragedy of needless pain rethinking the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.J Law Med Ethics. 2007 35 556570Crossref PubMed Scopus 36 Google Scholar The concrete links between infectious disease control and global security provide a compelling rationale for an inspection mechanism that encourages states to be more forthright and accountable in reporting a potential PHEIC.5UN Security CouncilSecurity Council Resolution 2177.httpswww.securitycouncilreport.orgatfcf7B65BFCF9B6D274E9C8CD3CF6E4FF96FF97DS_RES_2177.pdfDate 2014Date accessed June 15, 2020Google Scholar Relatedly, the process for declaring a PHEIC must be revisited. In a reimagined IHR, states should call for transparency in the deliberations that lead to a PHEIC, by publishing, for example, the transcript of discussion that led to the declaration of a PHEIC.6EcclestonTurner M KamradtScott A Transparency in IHR emergency committee decision making the case for reform.BMJ Glob Health. 2019 4e001618Crossref PubMed Scopus 20 Google Scholar Transparency would enhance accountability in the IHR process. Furthermore, states should consider replacing the rigid binary PHEIC architecture, whereby the decision is either no PHEIC or a PHEIC, with an incremental mechanism that would enable intermediate stages for IHRbased alerts and guidance.7Harvey F Ammar W Endo H et al.Interim Report on WHOs response to COVID19 JanuaryApril 2020.

Second, COVID19 has shown that all states must invest more domestic resources in their public health systems. Following more than a decade under the revised IHR, only a third of countries meet the core capacities of public health systems required therein,2WHOInternational Health Regulations, WHA 58.3.2nd edn.
