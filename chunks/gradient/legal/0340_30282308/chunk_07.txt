Id. citations omitted. The victories conservationists seemed to be winning in court proved shortlived, however. The other developer parties became more successful after they learned that more substantial impact studies could be used to win a case and that in local coalitions, strong arguments could be formed to present a proposed project as an overriding public benefit. In other words, it slowly dawned on both conservationists and economic actors that the procedural side of the legal argument was much more important than the substantive side, and that both substantive and procedural sides could be manipulated to a certain extent. Furthermore, conservation organizations realized that procedural battles over small sites and animals were eroding longstanding public support for nature conservation. They noticed that their role in policy making and planning was less and less accepted by other actors and by the general public, and that even their right to exist was questioned regularly.

The bulk of the decisions directly germane to the Directives that are considered in detail are from European and British courts.25 The clearest account of how European jurisprudence on the Directives has evolved in relation to the mandate to protect species appears in Charles George David Graham, After Morge, Where Are We Now? The Meaning of Disturbance in the Habitats Directive, id. at 4374.26 Denis Edwards, Judicial Review, the Precautionary Principle and the Protection of Habitats Do We Have a System of Administrative Law Yet? in id. at 209233.27 R Morge v Hampshire County Council 2009 EWHC 2940 Admin 2010 EWCA Civ 608 2011 UKSC 2.28 There is, of course, an argument to be made that courts concerns, especially at the higher levels of the judiciary, for settled institutional expectations, are very necessary and proper. This is the argument made in Andrew Waite, The Principle of Equilibrium in Environmental Law The Example of the Habitats Directive, in The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3 at 235251. It leads Waite to the conclusion that environmental protection laws, such as the Directives, will only succeed if they can accommodate proportionate economic growth. Id. at 250. In contrast, the other contributors to the book prioritize wildlife protection over regard for settled economic and institutional expectations, and their view of the success of the Directives is much more subdued, even negative.29 This is the major concern of George Graham, supra note 25.30 Id. at 5862 and 6670.31 The main effect of the ruling in Morge has been to weaken the UKs system of protection for EPS European protected species by removing the obligations upon local planning authorities to satisfy themselves before granting permission that a protected species would either not be disturbed, or that its disturbance would be lawfully licensed and by authorizing them to dispense with imposing a condition that the proposed activities be licensed before work can commence. It has thus removed what was previously a useful local mechanism for preventing harm to EPS, and has left only the criminal law ostensibly but not effectively enforced by Natural England to safeguard protected species from development. Id. at 7374.32 Again, this was most certainly not the case when the Directives were first adopted. In The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3, the organization of the chapters makes it difficult to bring all the key ambiguities into focus quickly. It is much easier to do this, however, in the maritime context, where implementation of the various provisions remains minimal and, therefore, very much a work in progress. See the quick review across the board of the key relevant ambiguities in Richard Cadell, The Maritime Dimensions of the Habitats Directive Past Challenges and Future Opportunities, in id. at 183207.33 The Habitats Directive 2012, supra note 3.34 Rebecca Clutten Isabella Tafur, Are Imperative Reasons Imperiling the Habitats Directive?
