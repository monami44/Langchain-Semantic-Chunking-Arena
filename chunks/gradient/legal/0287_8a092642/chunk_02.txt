In this paper, I would like to compare two approaches and reflect on them from the viewpoint of Polish administrative justice. To do that, I analyse the English legal framework of judicial review and its recent case law. I conclude that Polish administrative justice doesnt have the legal competence to evaluate the policymaking process and the role of the court should be limited to examining the decisions of the Supervisory Body.
