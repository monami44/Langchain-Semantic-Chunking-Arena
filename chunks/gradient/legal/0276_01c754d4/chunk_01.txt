This is the first book to offer an extensive cosmopolitan, crosscultural insight into the perennial controversy over the use of improperly obtained evidence in criminal trials. It challenges the conventional view that exclusionary rules are idiosyncratic of AngloAmerican law, and highlights the constitutionalisation and internationalisation of criminal evidence and procedure as a cause of rapprochement or divergence beyond the AngloAmerican and Continental law divide. Analysis focuses on confessional evidence and evidence obtained by search and seizure, telephone interceptions and other means of electronic surveillance.
