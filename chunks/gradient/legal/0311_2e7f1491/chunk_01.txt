The United States patent system has become sand rather than lubricant in the wheels of American progress. Such is the premise behind this provocative and timely book by two of the nations leading experts on patents and economic innovation. Innovation and Its Discontents tells the story of how recent changes in patentingan institutional process that was created to nurture innovationhave wreaked havoc on innovators, businesses, and economic productivity. Jaffe and Lerner, who have spent the past two decades studying the patent system, show how legal changes initiated in the 1980s converted the system from a stimulator of innovation to a creator of litigation and uncertainty that threatens the innovation process itself. In one telling vignette, Jaffe and Lerner cite a patent litigation campaign brought by a semiconductor chip designer that claims control of an entire category of computer memory chips. The firms claims are based on a modest 15year old invention, whose scope and influenced were broadened by secretly manipulating an industrywide cooperative standardsetting body.
