Against this background, the purpose of this Debate is threefold. First, we wish to provide scholars with the opportunity to present and wrap up the main results of their work on Europeanization. Second, we wish to invite them to exchange their respective findings, and to engage in a fruitful dialogue regarding which theoretical and empirical lessons can be drawn from the existing literature, and where we should go from there. Third, we wish to give nonSwiss scholars the opportunity to comment on the Swiss literature, to highlight its strengths and weaknesses in a comparative perspective, and to put forward recommendations for the future. To this end, we have asked contributors to this Debate to address the four following questions Not all contributors were able to answer these four questions. However, for the sake of consistency we thought it was worth starting with an ambitious purpose and asking contributors to do their best to address the same set of questions.
