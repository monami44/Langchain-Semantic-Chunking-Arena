The primary aim of the Swedish national population registration system is to obtain data that 1 reflect the composition, relationship and identities of the Swedish population and 2 can be used as the basis for correct decisions and measures by government and other regulatory authorities. For this purpose, Sweden has established two population registers 1 The Population Register, maintained by the Swedish National Tax Agency Folkbokföringsregistret and 2 The Total Population Register TPR maintained by the government agency Statistics Sweden Registret över totalbefolkningen. The registers contain data on life events including birth, death, name change, marital status, family relationships and migration within Sweden as well as to and from other countries.
