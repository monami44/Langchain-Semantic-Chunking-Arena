They capture the EUs footprint in primary i.e. laws, decrees and secondary i.e. ordinances legislation through a computer keyword search. Results indicate that the share of Europeanized legal reforms is systematically higher for secondary legislation enacted by the Executive than for primary legislation enacted by Parliament. Furthermore, manifest references to the EU in ordinances are mainly related to indirect Europeanization. In sum, a nonnegligible proportion of the Europeanization of Swiss policies seems to take place in the executive arena and cannot be linked to bilateral agreements. Wolf Linders article allows situating this Debate on Europeanization within the broader and earlier internationalization phenomenon. He relies on the Official Collection of Federal Legislation to analyze the evolution of the stock of domestic versus international law 19482007, as well as the evolution of lawmaking activities 19822007. Moreover, he focuses on the politics dimension, by looking at the related effects on the balance of power between parliament and government. Three trends emerge in the long run a continuous internationalization of the stock of federal law, with the proportion of international law reaching 53 in 2007 a growing role of the Government in laws that originate from international negotiations including agreements with the EU and, by contrast, a stronger impact of the Parliament on domestic legislation.
