Plants are crucial medicinal resources, with 80 of people relying on them for primary healthcare. The search for natural antiviral compounds is increasing, especially in semiarid ecosystems where abiotic stress promotes the production of beneficial secondary metabolites. This review highlights semiarid plants with the potential as functional foods to combat viral diseases and other illnesses. Literature was searched in databases like ScienceDirect to gather information on novel compounds from stresstolerant semiarid plant species. These compounds have potential uses in treating viral infections and other health issues such as diabetes and high blood pressure. The review screened 61 semiarid plants known for their antiviral metabolites. Eight plants were identified with novel antiviral compounds. Key metabolites include agathisflavone, pectic arabinogalactan, azadirachtin, aloin, aloeemodin, aloesaponarin I, allicin, terpenoids, chlorogenic acids, curcumin, chromones, βsitosterol, lupeol, oleuropein, carissol, βamyrin, and 9tetrahydrocannabinol. Stresstolerant semiarid plants are significant sources of metabolites for treating infectious diseases and boosting immune systems. Further research on these metabolites in animal models is needed to verify their efficacy for treating human diseases during endemic and pandemic outbreaks, such as COVID19. 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, BerlinBoston.
