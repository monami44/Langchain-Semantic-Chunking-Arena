BACKGROUND Long COVID, also known as postacute sequelae of COVID19 PASC, is a poorly understood condition with symptoms across a range of biological domains that often have debilitating consequences. Some have recently suggested that lingering SARSCoV2 virus particles in the gut may impede serotonin production and that low serotonin may drive many Long COVID symptoms across a range of biological systems. Therefore, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs, which increase synaptic serotonin availability, may be used to prevent or treat Long COVID. SSRIs are commonly prescribed for depression, therefore restricting a study sample to only include patients with depression can reduce the concern of confounding by indication. METHODS In an observational sample of electronic health records from patients in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative N3C with a COVID19 diagnosis between September 1, 2021, and December 1, 2022, and a comorbid depressive disorder, the leading indication for SSRI use, we evaluated the relationship between SSRI use during acute COVID19 and subsequent 12month risk of Long COVID defined by ICD10 code U09.9. We defined SSRI use as a prescription for SSRI medication beginning at least 30 days before acute COVID19 and not ending before SARSCoV2 infection. To minimize bias, we estimated relationships using nonparametric targeted maximum likelihood estimation to aggressively adjust for highdimensional covariates. RESULTS We analyzed a sample n 302,626 of patients with a diagnosis of a depressive condition before COVID19 diagnosis, where 100,803 33 were using an SSRI. We found that SSRI users had a significantly lower risk of Long COVID compared to nonusers adjusted causal relative risk 0.92, 95 CI 0.86, 0.99 and we found a similar relationship comparing new SSRI users first SSRI prescription 1 to 4 months before acute COVID19 with no prior history of SSRI use to nonusers adjusted causal relative risk 0.89, 95 CI 0.80, 0.98. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that SSRI use during acute COVID19 may be protective against Long COVID, supporting the hypothesis that serotonin may be a key mechanistic biomarker of Long COVID. 2024.
