BACKGROUND This report summarizes the discussions and conclusions from the Correlates of Protection for Next Generation Influenza Vaccines Lessons Learned from the COVID19 Pandemic meeting, which took place in Seattle, USA, from March 1, 2023, to March 3, 2023. CONCLUSIONS Discussions around influenza virus correlates of protection and their use continued from where the discussion had been left off in 2019. While there was not much progress in the influenza field itself, many lessons learned during the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, especially the importance of mucosal immunity, were discussed and can directly be applied to influenza correlates of protection. 2024 The Authors.
