However, a few publications provided criteria to consider and therapeutic ranking methods, which helped shape the development of the RST. The RST included eight criteria and several descriptors characteristics. A universal characteristic scoring scale from 10 to 10 was developed. The sum of all the characteristic scores yielded an overall benefit score for each therapeutic. The RST appropriately ranked therapeutics using a systematic, reliable and practical approach. CONCLUSION Phase 1 was successfully completed. The RST presents several distinct aspects compared with other tools, including its scoring scale and method, and capacity to factor in incomplete or pending information. It is anticipated that the framework used for the RST will lend itself to use in other dynamic situations involving many interventions.
