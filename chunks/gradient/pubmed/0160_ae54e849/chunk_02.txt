BACKGROUND The COVID19 outbreak meant that people were unable to attend artbased community classes such as dance. In response, activities transitioned to digital modes of delivery. In this study, we aimed to explore the feasibility, inclusivity, and impact of transitioning to an online dance class. METHODS Thirty communitydwelling older adults 5984 years old were recruited from community groups in Yorkshire UK. Participants completed an online survey at baseline and after attending 8 weeks of online dance classes. The survey captured perceived benefits on physical activity and mental wellbeing. Two separate focus groups N 12 were conducted to explore if the online dance transition could be an opportunity to keep this group active and socially connected. RESULTS Survey data revealed no significant difference in the amount of time engaged in physical activity, but mental wellbeing significantly improved. Themes from the focus groups included holistic wellbeing related to the experience of dance, inclusive participation of online dance, and online dance facilitating social connection and sense of belonging. CONCLUSIONS The research provided insight into the online transition of a dance class for older adults, especially regarding inclusivity, sense of belonging and social connection.
