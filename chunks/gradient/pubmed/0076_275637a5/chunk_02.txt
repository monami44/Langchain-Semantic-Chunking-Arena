BACKGROUND As the COVID19 pandemic unfolded, hundreds of investigational COVID19 therapeutics emerged. Maintaining situational awareness of this extensive and rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape represented an unprecedented challenge for the Public Health Agency of Canada, as it worked to promote and protect the health of Canadians. A tool to triage and prioritize the assessment of these therapeutics was needed. METHODS The objective was to develop and conduct an initial validation of a tool to identify investigational COVID19 therapeutics for further review based on an efficient preliminary assessment, using a systematic and reliable process that would be practical to validate, implement and update. Phase 1 of this pilot project consisted of a literature search to identify existing COVID19 therapeutic assessment prioritization tools, development of the Rapid Scoring Tool RST and initial validation of the tool. RESULTS No tools designed to rank investigational COVID19 therapeutics for the purpose of prioritizing their assessment were identified.
