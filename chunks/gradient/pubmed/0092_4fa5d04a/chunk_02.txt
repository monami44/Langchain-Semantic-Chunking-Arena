COVID19 vaccineinduced protection declines over time. This waning of immunity has been described in modelling as a lower level of protection. This study incorporated finescale vaccine waning into modelling to predict the next surge of the Omicron variant of the SARSCoV2 virus. In Hong Kong, the Omicron subvariant BA.2 caused a significant epidemic wave between February and April 2022, which triggered high vaccination rates. About half a year later, a second outbreak, dominated by a combination of BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, began to spread. We developed mathematical equations to formulate continuous changes in vaccine boosting and waning based on empirical serological data. These equations were incorporated into a multistrain discretetime SusceptibleExposedInfectiousRemoved model. The daily number of reported cases during the first Omicron outbreak, with daily vaccination rates, the population mobility index and daily average temperature, were used to train the model. The model successfully predicted the size and timing of the second surge and the variant replacement by BA.45. It estimated 655,893 cumulative reported cases from June 1, 2022 to 31 October 2022, which was only 2.69 fewer than the observed cumulative number of 674,008. The model projected that increased vaccine protection by larger vaccine coverage or no vaccine waning would reduce the size of the second surge of BA.2 infections substantially but would allow more subsequent BA.45 infections. Increased vaccine coverage or greater vaccine protection can reduce the infection rate during certain periods when the immuneescape variants cocirculate however, new immuneescape variants spread more by outcompeting the previous strain. 2024 The Authors.
