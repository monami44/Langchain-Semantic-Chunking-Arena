Despite large gains in health over the past few decades, the distribution of health risks worldwide remains extremely and unacceptably uneven. Although the health sector has a crucial role in addressing health inequalities, its efforts often come into conflict with powerful global actors in pursuit of other interests such as protection of national security, safeguarding of sovereignty, or economic goals. This is the starting point of The LancetUniversity of Oslo Commission on Global Governance for Health. With globalisation, health inequity increasingly results from transnational activities that involve actors with different interests and degrees of power states, transnational corporations, civil society, and others. The decisions, policies, and actions of such actors are, in turn, founded on global social norms. Their actions are not designed to harm health, but can have negative sideeffects that create health inequities. The norms, policies, and practices that arise from global political interaction across all sectors that affect health are what we call global political determinants of health. The Commission argues that global political determinants that unfavourably affect the health of some groups of people relative to others are unfair, and that at least some harms could be avoided by improving how global governance works. There is an urgent need to understand how public health can be better protected and promoted in the realm of global governance, but this issue is a complex and politically sensitive one. Global governance processes involve the distribution of economic, intellectual, normative, and political resources, and to assess their effect on health requires an analysis of power. This report examines power disparities and dynamics across a range of policy areas that affect health and that require improved global governance economic crises and austerity measures, knowledge and intellectual property, foreign investment treaties, food security, transnational corporate activity, irregular migration, and violent conflict. The case analyses show that in the contemporary global governance landscape, power asymmetries between actors with conflicting interests shape political determinants of health. Key messagesThe unacceptable health inequities within and between countries cannot be addressed within the health sector, by technical measures, or at the national level alone, but require global political solutionsNorms, policies, and practices that arise from transnational interaction should be understood as political determinants of health that cause and maintain health inequitiesPower asymmetry and global social norms limit the range of choice and constrain action on health inequity these limitations are reinforced by systemic global governance dysfunctions and require vigilance across all policy arenasThere should be independent monitoring of progress made in redressing health inequities, and in countering the global political forces that are detrimental to healthState and nonstate stakeholders across global policy arenas must be better connected for transparent policy dialogue in decisionmaking processes that affect healthGlobal governance for health must be rooted in commitments to global solidarity and shared responsibility sustainable and healthy development for all requires a global economic and political system that serves a global community of healthy people on a healthy planet The unacceptable health inequities within and between countries cannot be addressed within the health sector, by technical measures, or at the national level alone, but require global political solutionsNorms, policies, and practices that arise from transnational interaction should be understood as political determinants of health that cause and maintain health inequitiesPower asymmetry and global social norms limit the range of choice and constrain action on health inequity these limitations are reinforced by systemic global governance dysfunctions and require vigilance across all policy arenasThere should be independent monitoring of progress made in redressing health inequities, and in countering the global political forces that are detrimental to healthState and nonstate stakeholders across global policy arenas must be better connected for transparent policy dialogue in decisionmaking processes that affect healthGlobal governance for health must be rooted in commitments to global solidarity and shared responsibility sustainable and healthy development for all requires a global economic and political system that serves a global community of healthy people on a healthy planet We identified five dysfunctions of the global governance system that allow adverse effects of global political determinants of health to persist. First, participation and representation of some actors, such as civil society, health experts, and marginalised groups, are insufficient in decisionmaking processes democratic deficit.
