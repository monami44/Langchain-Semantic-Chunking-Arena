Abstract In the last decades, an increasing number of EU institutions and agencies have been given the power to conduct administrative inspections. While the legal literature has traditionally focused on the Commissions inspection powers in competition proceedings, the European AntiFraud Office OLAF, the European Central Bank ECB, the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA, the European Aviation Safety Agency EASA, and the European Fisheries Control Agency EFCA are also entrusted with such powers. The Commission has also been granted inspection powers in the field of Food Safety. Inspection powers can have a crucial impact on the fundamental right of the inviolability of the home, recognized by the Court of Justice as a general principle of EU law, and protected under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights ECHR and Article 7 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights ECFR. This Article argues that the current remedies do not fulfill all the criteria set forth by the Strasbourg Court for ex post judicial control vis√† vis inspections to be full and effective, in particular when these powers are used in the context of composite procedures, and suggests remedies to improve the system of review, in order to effectively protect fundamental rights.
