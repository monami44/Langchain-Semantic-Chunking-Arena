Abstract The development of a corpus of fundamental rights at the EU level has accentuated the constitutional pluralism that existed within many national legal systems. Illustrating the dynamic, the adjudication of the age discrimination provisions of the 2000 Framework Directive on Employment Equality in Germany produced two major outcomes. First, interactions between the ECJ and the German labour courts served to upgrade rights protections afforded to workers, relative to national constitutional standards. Second, the structural position of the German Federal Constitutional Court, as a privileged locus of rights protection, was weakened, while the authority of the labour courts was enhanced. Looking ahead, we are entering a new era of rightsbased legal integration that will further serve to Europeanize national law, while undermining the supposed unity and coherence of national legal orders. Keywords Constitutional pluralismEuropean Court of JusticeEuropeanizationlabour lawlegal integrationnondiscrimination Notes For a recent review of the social science literature on these topics, see Stone Sweet Citation2010. In many European legal orders, three such sources national constitutional rights, EU fundamental rights, the EU Charter of Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights coexist and, in some areas, substantively overlap. Individuals have a choice of which source to plead and judges have a choice of which right to enforce. We take no normative view in this article on whether the constitutional rhetoric is appropriate, or whether developments in this domain of law are normatively defensible. Marshall I 15284 Dori C9192. This gap in protection was partly closed by the emergence of the doctrine of state liability, holding that national judges can order state officials to compensate private parties for compliance failures see Francovich C6 990 Brasserie du Pecheur C4693 and C4893.

More generally, German labour law has always been regulated through a style of relatively autonomous judicial lawmaking that resembles practices found in the common law, as well as in ECJ decisionmaking, which has facilitated these dialogues. We thank an anonymous reviewer for emphasizing this important point. This fact scandalized specialists, including Bauer Citation2005. Arbeitsgericht München 2004, Neue Zeitschrift für ArbeitsrechtRechtsprechungsreport 101 4347. Däubler Citation2001 argued that the provision violated the Directive, while Koberski Citation2005 disagreed. The Court derived the right from various international instruments and the constitutional traditions common to the Member States.

In that ruling, the GFCC warned that it would invalidate any EU act having the effect of depriving German legislative organs of their control over legal norms created at the EU level. Private parties thereby possessed the right to plead the ultra vires nature of Community acts before all German judges, and to bring constitutional complaints alleging the same to the GFCC.

From the perspective of the ECJs case law on supremacy, the question is a version of one that has already been decided see Simmenthal II 10677. The member states only formally accepted the ECJs doctrine of supremacy in 2007, in Declaration 17 Concerning Primacy.

The evolution of the European Convention on Human Rights, as a body of directly effective, supralegislative if infraconstitutional rights, has also generated dynamics that are rapidly consolidating constitutional pluralism as a general, structural feature of European law Keller and Stone Sweet Citation2008 68289.
