The first public product of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services IPBES is its Conceptual Framework. This conceptual and analytical tool, presented here in detail, will underpin all IPBES functions and provide structure and comparability to the syntheses that IPBES will produce at different spatial scales, on different themes, and in different regions. Salient innovative aspects of the IPBES Conceptual Framework are its transparent and participatory construction process and its explicit consideration of diverse scientific disciplines, stakeholders, and knowledge systems, including indigenous and local knowledge. Because the focus on coconstruction of integrative knowledge is shared by an increasing number of initiatives worldwide, this framework should be useful beyond IPBES, for the wider research and knowledgepolicy communities working on the links between nature and people, such as natural, social and engineering scientists, policymakers at different levels, and decisionmakers in different sectors of society.
