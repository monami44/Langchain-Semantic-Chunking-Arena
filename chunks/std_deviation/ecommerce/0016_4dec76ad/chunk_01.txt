The development of information and communications technology ICT has promoted the rapid growth of ecommerce, which has gradually changed the city. Networking and migration are also key driving forces for contemporary urban development. Although a growing body of literature has studied ecommerce development, there is a lack of theoretical and empirical research to understand the impact of ecommerce and migration on urbanism. This study is an attempt to fill the gap. It firstly proposes a concept framework of Eurbanism that includes three interwoven layers, namely of ICT infrastructure and production networks, social networks and power relations, and urban form and land use. The framework is then applied to understand the influence of ecommerce and migration on the sociospatial transformation of Taobao villages in Guangzhou city, China. This article concludes that ICT infrastructure and production networks form the foundation of ecommerce development, while social networks of rural migrants are important sources of social capital in the formation of Taobao villages. The existing physical forms provide opportunities for ecommerce growth, which has in turn reshaped them. Ecommerce is fundamentally revolutionizing urbanism, the intertwinement of social and spatial reorganization of the city.
