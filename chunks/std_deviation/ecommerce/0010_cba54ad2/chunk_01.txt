This study aims to provide an overview of ecommerce adoption by SMEs in developing countries and, in particular, the extent of the adoption of ecommerce by Indonesian SMEs. It identifies the ecommerce benefits realized by these SMEs and investigates the relationship between the levels of ecommerce adoption and the benefits thus realized. The study was motivated by the limited studies related to ecommerce adoption by SMEs, especially in developing countries. In addition, it seems that most ecommerce studies are focused more on upstream issues to see the factors that facilitate, or barriers faced regarding ecommerce adoption, rather than downstream issues to see postadoption benefits. This certainly limits our understanding about ecommerce adoption by SMEs in developing countries, as well as the postadoption benefits of ecommerce. Indonesia was chosen as the place in which to conduct the study. A survey of 292 SMEs shows that the majority of them are still at an early stage in their adoption of ecommerce. Their use of ecommerce is dominated by marketing and purchasing and procurement activities. Extending market reach, increased sales, improved external communication, improved company image, improved speed of processing, and increased employee productivity are reported as the top six ecommerce benefits perceived by these SMEs. This study also shows that SMEs at the higher level of ecommerce adoption experience greater ecommerce benefits than those at other levels of adoption.
