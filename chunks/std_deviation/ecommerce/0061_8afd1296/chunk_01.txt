Since the turn of the century especially small, local retailers struggle with the advent of ecommerce. It is hence no surprise that the retail sector is one of the hardesthit sectors in the current pandemic. To understand the short and longerterm impacts of COVID19 on retail, we conducted two surveys to understand ongoing changes in the sector. By contrasting changing consumer behavior with the actions taken by local retailers, we assess whether the current pandemic is potentially a catalyst for ecommerce in Belgium. We do this based on a newly constructed framework of eretail accessibility, as the differences between online and physical retail require a revision of the traditional economic geographical perspective on retail performance as introduced by Christaller 1933. We conclude that the COVID19 pandemic holds ample opportunities for an increase in the three components of eretail accessibility, but that a lack of professionalism might prevent traditional local retailers to retain a share of the expanded online market. This could well mean the final blow for local brick and mortar shops if, as is predicted, the share of online shopping in total retail expenditure remains high after the pandemic.
