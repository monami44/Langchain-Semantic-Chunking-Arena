The killings during the Second World War WWII, with nearly 100,000 victims, is one of the greatest losses of life in Slovenias modern history and most of the victims are still buried in hidden mass graves and remain unidentified. Identity, ancestry, and phenotypic SNPs, as well as STR markers are already used for solving various cases with Next Generation Sequencing NGS technology. In this study, the Precision ID GlobalFiler NGS STR panel was used to identify the WWII victim that could not be identified with capillary electrophoresis CE analyses because limited statistical support was obtained after amplification of autosomal STRs using CE STR kits. Bones and teeth were analysed and compared to family references nephew and niece on paternal line. Prior to DNA isolation 0.5 g of powder was decalcified. The DNA was purified in a Biorobot EZ1 device. The nuclear DNA of the samples was quantified with the PowerQuant kit. Because the recommended posterior probability PP of 99.9 was followed with the goal of high confidence of correct identification, the NGS STR Panel was used, and after the analysis of additional STR loci the statistical calculation showed a PP of 99.99986, showing that a large enough number of genetic markers were analysed when identifying the skeletal remains of the aunt. PP value endorsed the hypothesis that the tooth and bone samples were from individual related to the family references rather than from unrelated individual. In presented case, NGS technology proved to be a powerful tool for increasing the number of autosomal STRs needed for identification of WWII victims when linear markers cannot be used for comparison and only distant relatives are available for analyses.
