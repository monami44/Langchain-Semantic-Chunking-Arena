Abstract Sexual policies were a core component of the National Socialist racial policies, both in the Altreich territories considered part of Nazi Germany before 1938, as well as in the occupied territories. In occupied Poland the Germans imposed a prohibition of contact Umgangsverbot with the local Polish population, a restriction that covered both social as well as sexual encounters. But this model of absolute racial segregation was never truly implemented. This paper attempts to show that there existed a wide range of sexual contacts between the occupiers and the local inhabitants, with the focus here being on consensual and forced contacts sexual violence as seen against the backdrop of National Socialist policies. This article positions itself at the intersection of the history of everyday life Alltagsgeschichte, the history of sexuality and the gender history of the German occupation of Poland perspectives that have rarely been used with regard to this region.
