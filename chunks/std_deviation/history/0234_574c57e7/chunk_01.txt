To test the usefulness of the forensic PCRMPS approach to eye and hair color prediction for aged skeletons, a customized version of the PCRMPS HIrisPlex panel was used on two sets of samples. The first set contained 11 skeletons dated from the 3rd to the 18th centuries AD, and for each of them at least four bone types were analyzed for a total of 47 samples. In the second set, 24 skeletons from the Second World War were analyzed, and only petrous bones from the skulls were tested. Goodquality libraries were achieved in 83.3 of the cases for the ancient skeletons and in all Second World War petrous bones, with 94.7 and 100 of the markers, respectively, suitable for SNP typing. Consensus typing was achieved for about 91.7 of the markers in 10 out of 11 ancient skeletons, and the HIrisPlexS webtool was then used to generate phenotypic predictions. Full predictions were achieved for 3 27.3 ancient skeletons and 12 50 Second World War petrous bones. In the remaining cases, different levels of AUC area under the receiver operating curve loss were computed because of no available data NA for 8.3 of markers in ancient skeletons and 4.2 of markers in Second World War petrous bones. Although the PCRbased approach has been replaced with new techniques in ancient DNA studies, the results show that customized forensic technologies can be successfully applied to aged bone remains, highlighting the role of the template in the success of PCRMPS analysis. However, because several typical errors of ancient DNA sequencing were scored, replicate tests and accurate evaluation by an expert remain indispensable tools.
