Treatment modifications adopted during pandemic aimed at reducing infection, myelosuppression, and optimizing hospital resources. This study evaluated outcomes for pediatric patients with ALL who had treatment modifications during pandemic compared to historical cohorts at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt. Bidirectional cohort study included 378 patients. Treatment modifications included omission of specific drugs or adjusting chemotherapy schedules to 6mercaptopurinemethotrexate. Median followup were 45.1 and 43.2 months, for cohorts A and B, respectively. The threeyear overall survival were 84.9 and 87.5 p .48 and threeyear relapse free survival were 82.8 and 86.5 p .11 for cohorts A and B, respectively. Infectionrelated mortality was 11 and 4.4 for cohorts A and B, respectively p .03. Treatment modifications adopted during the pandemic did not adversely affect the outcome of patients with ALL and notably reduced infectionrelated deaths. Longer followup is warranted to validate these findings. DOI 10.108010428194.2024.2411432 PMID 39381951
