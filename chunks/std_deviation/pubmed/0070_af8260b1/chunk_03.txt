43Sri Venkateshwara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati. Background objectives Genetic analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 strains circulating in India during 20202022 was carried out to understand the evolution of potentially expanding and divergent clades. Methods SARSCoV2 sequences n612 randomly selected from among the sequences of samples collected through a nationwide network of Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratories during 2020 n1532 and Indian sequences available in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data during March 2020March 2022 n53077, were analyzed using the phylogeo haplotype network approach with reference to the Wuhan prototype sequence. Results On haplotype analysis, 420 haplotypes were revealed from 643 segregating sites among the sequences. Haplotype sharing was noted among the strains from different geographical regions. Nevertheless, the genetic distance among the viral haplotypes from different clades could differentiate the strains into distinct haplo groups regarding variant emergence. Interpretation conclusions The haplotype analysis revealed that the G and GR clades were coevolved and an epicentrefor the evolution of the GH, GK and GRA clades. GH was more frequently identified in northern parts of India than in other parts, whereas GK was detected less in north India than in other parts. Thus, the network analysis facilitated a detailed illustration of the pathways of evolution and circulation of SARSCoV2 variants. DOI 10.25259IJMR_252_23 PMID 39382457 Indexed for MEDLINE
