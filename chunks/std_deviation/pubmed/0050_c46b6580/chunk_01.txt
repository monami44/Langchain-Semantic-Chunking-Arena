OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine the thyroid hormone profile and its association with severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2. METHODS This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted to a tertiary hospital due to SARSCoV2 infection between February 18 and May 18, 2022. Clinical data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical record system. Based on the thyroid function, patients were divided into five groups normal, nonthyroid illness syndrome NTIS, hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, and unclassified. The association between thyroid function and severe COVID19 was detected using multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic splines analysis. RESULTS This study included 3,161 patients, with 7.7 of them developing severe COVID19. 44.9 of the patients had normal thyroid function, 36.5 had NTIS, 6.7 had hypothyroidism, and 1.0 had thyrotoxicosis on admission. After adjusting for age, sex, and relevant clinical characteristics, NTIS and hypothyroidism were associated with increased risks of severe COVID19 odds ratio OR 2.38, 95 confidence interval CI 1.593.56 and OR 2.29, 95 CI 1.234.26, respectively, compared to normal thyroid function group. Among patients with NTIS or hypothyroidism, higher levels of total triiodothyronine TT3 are associated with lower risks of severe COVID19 OR 0.73, 95 CI 0.640.82, for every 0.1nmolL increase in TT3 level. CONCLUSION Thyroid hormone profiles of NTIS or hypothyroidism are associated with increased risks of severe COVID19. The decreased level of TT3 correlated with the increased risk of severe COVID19 in patients with NTIS or hypothyroidism. Copyright 2024 Yang, Qian, Wu, Xu, Qu, Zhou, Liu, Zhu, Wang and Zhao.
