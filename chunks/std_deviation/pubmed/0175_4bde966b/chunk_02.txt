INTRODUCTIONOBJECTIVE We investigated 1 work status changes during COVID19, 2 financial resource adequacy, 3 preferences for work requirements e.g. remote, workplace, mixed and 4 work requirements versus preferences, among people with systemic sclerosis. METHODS This was a crosssectional study of participants in the Scleroderma Patientcentered Intervention Network COVID19 Cohort, which enrolled participants from the ongoing Scleroderma Patientcentered Intervention Network Cohort and externally in April 2020. In August 2022, participants completed questions on work status, financial wellbeing using the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Financial WellBeing Scale, work requirements and work requirement preferences. RESULTS A total of 298 participants with systemic sclerosis were included. Mean age was 58.6 years SD 11.4. There were 101 34 participants working at the start of the pandemic and still working in August 2022, 179 60 not working at the start of the pandemic and still not working, 10 3 who stopped working after April 2020 and 8 3 who started working. Mean financial wellbeing did not change from April 2020 to August 2022 difference 0.2 points 95 confidence interval 1.1 to 0.7. Working participants N 109 preferred flexible work requirements N 34, 31 or working entirely remotely N 32, 29, but most were required to work entirely at a workplace N 35, 32 or combined workplace and remotely with a fixed schedule N 31, 28. CONCLUSION Work status and financial wellbeing did not change substantively among people with systemic sclerosis during the pandemic. Flexible work policies may support people with systemic sclerosis to work. The Authors 2024.
