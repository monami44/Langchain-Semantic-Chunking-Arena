INTRODUCTION Burkina Faso implemented stringent measures in response to the COVID19 pandemic that profoundly affected its economy and might have exacerbated food insecurity. While prior studies have assessed the impact of these measures on consumers, there is a dearth of evidence of its effects on food producers in SubSaharan Africa. This study aims i to evaluate the repercussions of COVID19 on the possession of food production assets and on the number of livestock owned and ii to determine the correlation between the food insecurity experience scale FIES score, ownership of these assets, and the number of livestock owned. METHODS This study employs a prepost comparison design in two panels of randomly selected households in Burkina Faso. While Panel A was constituted of 384 households predominantly 76 living in rural areas, Panel B comprised 504 households, only half of which 51 lived in rural areas. All households were visited twice in July 2019 and February 2021, for Panel A, and in February 2020 and February 2021, for Panel B. Panel B was added to the study before the pandemic thanks to additional funding the timing of the survey was harmonized in both panels for the second round. Regression models were used with fixed effects at the household level, controlling for potential timeinvariant confounding variables, and correlation coefficients between possession of production assets or number of livestock and FIES score were measured. RESULTS Our findings indicate that the possession of some assets in Panel A cart, livestock, bicycle, watch was significantly reduced during the pandemic, as was the herd sizes among livestockowning households in both panels. Households with fewer production assets and number of livestock were more likely to experience food insecurity. CONCLUSION This study underscores the vulnerability of rural households in Burkina Faso to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID19 pandemic. Addressing the challenges faced by farming and livestockowning households is crucial for mitigating food insecurity and improving resilience in the face of ongoing crises. 2024.
