This study aims i to evaluate the repercussions of COVID19 on the possession of food production assets and on the number of livestock owned and ii to determine the correlation between the food insecurity experience scale FIES score, ownership of these assets, and the number of livestock owned.",

To analyze the effects of electrostatic interactions on viral capsids, we construct a model of 2D isotropic elastic shells with embedded point charges located in the centers of mass of individual proteins. We find that modification of the electrostatic interactions between proteins affects not only the size and shape of capsids, but in addition induces substantial deformations of hexamers in capsid structures.",

                    "Classical epidemiology relies on incidence, mortality rates, and clinical data from individual testing, which can be challenging for many countries. Therefore, innovative, flexible, cost-effective, and scalable surveillance techniques are needed. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a highly powerful tool in this regard. WBE analyses substances excreted in human fluids and faeces that enter the sewer system. This approach provides insights into community health status and lifestyle habits. WBE serves as an early warning system for viral surveillance, detecting the emergence of new pathogens, changes in incidence rates, identifying future trends, studying outbreaks, and informing the performance of action plans.",
                    "While WBE has long been used to study different viruses such as poliovirus and norovirus, its implementation has surged due to the pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. This has led to the establishment of wastewater surveillance programmes at international, national, and community levels, many of which remain operational. Furthermore, WBE is increasingly applied to study other pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, parasites, fungi, and emerging viruses, with new methodologies being developed.",
                    "Consequently, the primary focus now is on creating international frameworks to enhance states' preparedness against future health risks. However, there remains considerable work to be done, particularly in integrating the principles of One Health into epidemiological surveillance to acknowledge the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and the environment in pathogen transmission. Thus, a broader approach to analysing the three pillars of One Health must be developed, transitioning from WBE to wastewater and environmental surveillance, and establishing this approach as a routine practice in public health."
