                    "Increased academic engagement with videoconferencing predicted lower academic performance and higher psychological distress. Both relationships were mediated by sleep. Use of videoconferencing for personal reasons, however, was directly associated with a reduction in distress. CONCLUSION Videoconferencing is an important determinant of sleep and may impact health and wellness as well as academic outcomes in young adults. The effects of virtual communication on sleep and human behavior warrant further study in this and other populations."

Some have recently suggested that lingering SARSCoV2 virus particles in the gut may impede serotonin production and that low serotonin may drive many Long COVID symptoms across a range of biological systems. Therefore, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs, which increase synaptic serotonin availability, may be used to prevent or treat Long COVID.",

We defined SSRI use as a prescription for SSRI medication beginning at least 30 days before acute COVID19 and not ending before SARSCoV2 infection. To minimize bias, we estimated relationships using nonparametric targeted maximum likelihood estimation to aggressively adjust for highdimensional covariates.",

In lateral flow assays, gold nanoparticle bioconjugates serve as labels which display affinity molecules on the gold surface. While examples of nanobody gold nanoparticle bioconjugates exist, few utilise the simple onestep approach of physisorption owing to undesirable nanoparticle aggregation and loss of functionality. Here we show that engineering nanobodies into multivalent structures can significantly enhance their functionality when physisorbed onto gold nanoparticles.",

Specifically, we show that the trivalent version of VHHV nanobody VHH3 against the S1 protein of SARSCoV2 can be immobilised onto gold nanoparticles through passive adsorption. Unlike its monovalent and bivalent nanobody counterparts, using VHHV3 preserves nanoparticle stability under salt stress, blocking, washing, and freezedrying conditions while maintaining picomolar sensitivity to the S1 protein.",

Between May 2021-April 2022, 182 adults with a Distress Questionnaire-5 score \u22658 indicative of depression were recruited from a tertiary mental health service in regional Victoria, Australia and surrounds. Participants were assigned to six 90-min sessions over 8 weeks using group-based, online videoconferencing comprising 1) lifestyle therapy targeting nutrition, physical activity with a dietitian and exercise physiologist (n=91) or 2) psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) with psychologists (n=91). The primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression at 8 weeks (noninferiority margin 2) using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE).",

                    "In recent years a substantial literature has emerged concerning bias, discrimination, and fairness in artificial intelligence AI and machine learning. Connecting this work to existing legal nondiscrimination frameworks is essential to create tools and methods that are practically useful across divergent legal regimes. While much work has been undertaken from an American legal perspective, comparatively little has mapped the effects and requirements of EU law. This Article addresses this critical gap between legal, technical, and organisational notions of algorithmic fairness. Through analysis of EU nondiscrimination law and jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice ECJ and national courts, we identify a critical incompatibility between European notions of discrimination and existing work on algorithmic and automated fairness.",
                    "A clear gap exists between statistical measures of fairness as embedded in myriad fairness toolkits and governance mechanisms and the context-sensitive, often intuitive and ambiguous discrimination metrics and evidential requirements used by the ECJ we refer to this approach as contextual equality. This Article makes three contributions. First, we review the evidential requirements to bring a claim under EU nondiscrimination law. Due to the disparate nature of algorithmic and human discrimination, the EUs current requirements are too contextual, reliant on intuition, and open to judicial interpretation to be automated. Many of the concepts fundamental to bringing a claim, such as the composition of the disadvantaged and advantaged group, the severity and type of harm suffered, and requirements for the relevance and admissibility of evidence, require normative or political choices to be made by the judiciary on a case-by-case basis.",
                    "Second, we show how the legal protection offered by nondiscrimination law is challenged when AI, not humans, discriminate. Humans discriminate due to negative attitudes e.g. stereotypes, prejudice and unintentional biases e.g. organisational practices or internalised stereotypes which can act as a signal to victims that discrimination has occurred. Equivalent signalling mechanisms and agency do not exist in algorithmic systems. Compared to traditional forms of discrimination, automated discrimination is more abstract and unintuitive, subtle, intangible, and difficult to detect. The increasing use of algorithms disrupts traditional legal remedies and procedures for detection, investigation, prevention, and correction of discrimination which have predominantly relied upon intuition."

These gaps in the legislation should be addressed at the legislative level, and not remain subject of judicial lawmaking, as judicial practice is not stable. Moreover, it should be in accordance with the requirements of European institutions in the sphere of enforcement, according to which national legislation should contain a clear definition of the conditions for enforcement, the statutory enforcement provisions should be worked out clearly, avoiding the possibility for misinterpretation.",

The IHR obliges states to notify WHO of any event that may constitute a PHEIC within 24 h after public health authorities assessment. Evidence indicates that some public health authorities in Wuhan, China, suspected what later became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for several weeks before WHO was privy to the information. Without legal authority to independently visit China and review the outbreak situation, WHO faced a barrier in mounting a cogent global response. In a reimagined IHR, states should allow for information to be received from nonstate actors without being subject to verification from the state in question, as currently required by the IHR. Moreover, national accountability should be strengthened by mandating independent experts to conduct missions to states so that they can review potential outbreak situations.",
                    "Second, COVID19 has shown that all states must invest more domestic resources in their public health systems. Following more than a decade under the revised IHR, only a third of countries meet the core capacities of public health systems required therein, impacting countries abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks and putting the whole world at risk. States should consider bolstering the IHR provisions for international assistance, including incorporating a financial mechanism to assist lowincome countries in building and sustaining required capacities. To ensure accountability for national capacity building, states should integrate an effective reporting mechanism to monitor implementation of IHR obligations. Robust reporting procedures generally require states to submit periodic national reports on the measures adopted, progress made, and problems encountered in the implementation of a treaty and, crucially, to incorporate some type of independent review.",
                    "Third, the COVID19 pandemic confirms how disruptive health measures can be for trade, transport, and economic activities. Disputes over the legality of such health measures are likely, and agreed mechanisms to settle them would prevent political tensions from becoming disruptions. Some disputes lend themselves to longer judicial processes, but many would benefit from prompt and practical mechanisms of resolution. The IHR provides a range of options, but these have never been publicly used. Multilateral dispute resolution processes, including consultation forums among concerned states and an active good offices role by the WHO DirectorGeneral preceding the dispute resolution process, could provide pragmatic solutions. Fundamentally, states must tackle the overarching issue of ambiguity in the text of the regulations in any future IHR reform process."

Most accounts limit themselves to brief, stipulative definitions along the lines of Backsliding makes elections less competitive without entirely undermining the electoral mechanism Waldner Lust, 2018, p. 95 or to cite a quite different definition of democratic backsliding backsliding denotes the stateled debilitation or elimination of any of the political institutions that sustain an existing democracy Bermeo, 2016, p. 5.",

I suggest that the tradition of critical theory can provide useful theoretical resources for constructing an account of democratic backsliding that meets these demands.

Their judicial adjudication may also contribute indirectly to a range of tasks to prevent war, protect human rights and foreign direct investments, harmonize international law, but also to usurp lawmaking power or perpetuate global injustice and domination. As ICs proliferate and gain power across ever more domains, they become targets of a bewildering range of resistance. Criticisms often invoke legitimacy. Some question ICs origins querying, for instance, why developing states are forced to accept investment tribunals that privilege foreign investors.",

There are certainly reasons to lament recalcitrant states who fail to join ICs that are efficacious and necessary for morally mandatory aims, such as, arguably, to address war crimes, or to protect human rights and the environment. This account acknowledges some of these concerns. States may often have good reason to defer to certain ICs, yet fail to do so, and they may have several further reasons not to free ride on those who consent. Yet some such criticisms may be overdrawn, and often beg the question of which might be better mechanisms than consent to identify state obligations. A common yet problematic argument for state consent is the presumptive ability of state representatives to speak and act on behalf of nations and their citizenry which confers a significant degree of legitimacy on international courts.",
                    "On the present account, descriptive legitimacy refers to social facts concerning actors beliefs about the legitimate authority of the IC. Such beliefs about normative legitimacy sometimes appear to have motivating force. Compliance may, of course, be due not to such beliefs, but simply because it is cheap when the IC requires actors to do what they would anyway have done. But actors belief in the legitimate authority of an IC may contribute to more costly compliance, because agents believe that the judgment gives them a new reason to act in certain ways, which makes them somewhat more likely to act accordingly. Governments belief in the legitimate authority of an IC can engender enough diffuse support to secure deference to it even by those who lose a case or disagree with a legal interpretation. This normative compliance pull may be due to the IC being seen to carry out the tasks discussed above international courts will enjoy support and be accepted as authoritative only if states and other key stakeholders perceive them as beneficial, at least in the long run."

To that end, Switzerland has relied on a twofold strategy. On the one hand, it has negotiated agreements with the EU on a bilateral basis. This is the so-called direct form of Europeanization. On the other hand, however, the country has also adapted unilaterally to existing EU rules. In Switzerland, this indirect form of Europeanization is also known as autonomous adaptation (autonomer Nachvollzug).",

To be sure, we know that EU influence also occurs even in the absence of international negotiations, but we do not know exactly to which extent Switzerland has been affected. That is, we do not know which policy sectors have been most influenced by indirect Europeanization, and how much the country has unilaterally adapted. There are, however, good reasons to believe that the extent of autonomous adaptation is considerable. Since 1988 the Federal Council has introduced a euro-compatibility examination in the message accompanying bills submitted to the Parliament.",

In fact, it is not unlikely that indirect Europeanization has stronger effects than direct Europeanization. Finally, while this Debate is dedicated to Europeanization policy processes and outputs, we have to keep in mind that the EU is but one partner among others even if it is arguably the most crucial partner for a country located in the middle of Europe such as Switzerland."

First, participation and representation of some actors, such as civil society, health experts, and marginalised groups, are insufficient in decisionmaking processes democratic deficit. Second, inadequate means to constrain power and poor transparency make it difficult to hold actors to account for their actions weak accountability mechanisms. Third, norms, rules, and decisionmaking procedures are often impervious to changing needs and can sustain entrenched power disparities, with adverse effects on the distribution of health institutional stickiness. Fourth, inadequate means exist at both national and global levels to protect health in global policymaking arenas outside of the health sector, such that health can be subordinated under other objectives inadequate policy space for health. Lastly, in a range of policymaking areas, there is a total or near absence of international institutions eg, treaties, funds, courts, and softer forms of regulation such as norms and guidelines to protect and promote health missing or nascent institutions.",

There should be independent monitoring of progress made in redressing health inequities, and in countering the global political forces that are detrimental to health. State and nonstate stakeholders across global policy arenas must be better connected for transparent policy dialogue in decisionmaking processes that affect health. Global governance for health must be rooted in commitments to global solidarity and shared responsibility sustainable and healthy development for all requires a global economic and political system that serves a global community of healthy people on a healthy planet.",
                    "Recognising that major drivers of ill health lie beyond the control of national governments and, in many instances, also outside of the health sector, we assert that some of the root causes of health inequity must be addressed within global governance processes. For the continued success of the global health system, its initiatives must not be thwarted by political decisions in other arenas. Rather, global governance processes outside the health arena must be made to work better for health. The Commission calls for stronger crosssectoral global action for health. We propose for consideration a Multistakeholder Platform on Governance for Health, which would serve as a policy forum to provide space for diverse stakeholders to frame issues, set agendas, examine and debate policies in the making that would have an effect on health and health equity, and identify barriers and propose solutions for concrete policy processes."
